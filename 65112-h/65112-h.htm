<p><em>The scene is a room scrupulously neat and clean and plainly
furnished. The walls are painted green, the woodwork,
white. In the rear at the left an open doorway leads
into a hall. Its bare, green wall and white baseboard
are all that can be seen of it. It leads into the other
rooms of the flat. In the centre of the rear wall of
the room is a window. It is shut. The white sash
curtains are pushed to right and left as far as they will
go. The green shade is rolled up to the top. Through
the window can be seen the red bricks of a house wall,
and the tops of a couple of trees moving now and then
in the wind. Within the window, and just below the
sill, is a shelf upon which are a few potted plants.
Between the window and the door is a bookcase full of
books and above it, hanging on the wall, a simply
framed, inexpensive copy of Millet’s “The Reapers.”
There is a run extending from the right center to just
below the right upper entrance. It is the vestibule of
the flat. Its open doorway faces the left wall. In the
right wall near the front is another window. Here the
sash curtains are drawn together and the green shade
is partly lowered. The window is up from the bottom.
Through it street noises can be heard. In front of this
window is an open, threaded sewing-machine. Some
frail, white fabric is lying upon it. There is a chair in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
front of the machine and at the machine’s left a small
table covered with a green cloth. In the rear of the
left wall and directly opposite to the entrance to the flat
is the doorway leading into the kitchenette, dishes
on shelves can be seen behind glass doors.</em></p>

<p><em>In the center of the left wall is a fireplace with a grate in it
for coals; over this is a wooden mantel painted white.
In the center is a small clock. A pair of vases, green
and white in coloring, one at each end, complete the
ornaments. Over the mantel is a narrow mirror; and
over this, hanging on the wall, Burne-Jones’ “Golden
Stairs,” simply framed. Against the front end of the
left wall is an upright piano with a stool in front of it.
On top is music neatly piled. Hanging over the piano
is Raphael’s “Sistine Madonna.” In the center of the
floor is a green rug, and in the center of this, a rectangular
dining-room table, the long side facing front. It
is covered with a green table-cloth. Three dining-room
chairs are at the table, one at either end and one at the
rear facing front. Above the table is a chandelier with
four gas jets enclosed by glass globes. At the right
front center is a rather shabby arm-chair upholstered
in green.</em></p>
</div>

<p class="pad2">Left and right from the spectator’s point of view.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>Before the sewing-machine, Mrs. Loving is seated. She
looks worried. She is sewing swiftly and deftly by
hand upon a waist in her lap. It is a white, beautiful
thing and she sews upon it delicately. It is about half-past
four in the afternoon; and the light is failing.
Mrs. Loving pauses in her sewing, rises and lets the
window-shade near her go up to the top. She pushes
the sash-curtains to either side, the corner of a red
brick house wall being thus brought into view. She
shivers slightly, then pushes the window down at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
the bottom and lowers it a trifle from the top. The
street noises become less distinct. She takes off her
thimble, rubs her hands gently, puts the thimble on
again, and looks at the clock on the mantel. She then
reseats herself, with her chair as close to the window as
possible and begins to sew. Presently a key is heard,
and the door opens and shuts noisily. Rachel comes
in from the vestibule. In her left arm she carries four
or five books strapped together; under her right, a roll
of music. Her hat is twisted over her left ear and her
hair is falling in tendrils about her face. She brings
into the room with her the spirit of abounding life,
health, joy, youth. Mrs. Loving pauses, needle in
hand, as soon as she hears the turning key and the
banging door. There is a smile on her face. For a
second, mother and daughter smile at each other.
Then Rachel throws her books upon the dining-room
table, places the music there also, but with care, and
rushing to her mother, gives her a bear hug and a kiss.</em></p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Ma dear! dear, old Ma dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Look out for the needle, Rachel! The waist!
Oh, Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>On her knees and shaking her finger directly under
her mother’s nose.</em>): You old, old fraud! You know
you adore being hugged. I’ve a good mind....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Now, Rachel, please! Besides, I know your
tricks. You think you can make me forget you are late.
What time is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Looking at the clock and expressing surprise</em>):
Jiminy Xmas! (<em>Whistles</em>) Why, it’s five o’clock!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Severely</em>): Well!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Plaintively</em>): Now, Ma dear, you’re going to be
horrid and cross.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): Really, Rachel, that expression
is not particularly affecting, when your hat is over your
ear, and you look, with your hair over your eyes, exactly
like some one’s pet poodle. I wonder if you are ever
going to grow up and be ladylike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh! Ma dear, I hope not, not for the longest time,
two long, long years at least. I just want to be silly and
irresponsible, and have you to love and torment, and, of
course, Tom, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Smiling down at Rachel</em>): You’ll not make
me forget, young lady. Why are you late, Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, Ma dear, I’m your pet poodle, and my hat
is over my ear, and I’m late, for the loveliest reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Don’t be silly, Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: That may sound silly, but it isn’t. And please
don’t “Rachel” me so much. It was honestly one whole
hour ago when I opened the front door down stairs. I
know it was, because I heard the postman telling some one
it was four o’clock. Well, I climbed the first flight, and
was just starting up the second, when a little shrill voice
said, “’Lo!” I raised my eyes, and there, half-way up
the stairs, sitting in the middle of a step, was just the
clearest, cutest, darlingest little brown baby boy you ever
saw. “’Lo! yourself,” I said. “What are you doing, and
who are you anyway?” “I’m Jimmy; and I’m widing to
New York on the choo-choo tars.” As he looked entirely
too young to be going such a distance by himself, I asked
him if I might go too. For a minute or two he considered
the question and me very seriously, and then he said,
“’Es,” and made room for me on the step beside him.
We’ve been everywhere: New York, Chicago, Boston,
London, Paris and Oshkosh. I wish you could have heard
him say that last place. I suggested going there just to
hear him. Now, Ma dear, is it any wonder I am late? See
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>all the places we have been in just one “teeny, weeny”
hour? We would have been traveling yet, but his horrid,
little mother came out and called him in. They’re
in the flat below, the new people. But before he went,
Ma dear, he said the “cunningest” thing. He said, “Will
you tum out an’ p’ay wif me aden in two minutes?” I
nearly hugged him to death, and it’s a wonder my hat is
on my head at all. Hats are such unimportant nuisances
anyway!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Unimportant nuisances! What ridiculous
language you do use, Rachel! Well, I’m no prophet, but
I see very distinctly what is going to happen. This little
brown baby will be living here night and day. You’re not
happy unless some child is trailing along in your rear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Mischievously</em>): Now, Ma dear, whose a hypocrite?
What? I suppose you don’t like children! I can
tell you one thing, though, it won’t be my fault if he isn’t
here night and day. Oh, I wish he were all mine, every
bit of him! Ma dear, do you suppose that “she woman”
he calls mother would let him come up here until it is
time for him to go to bed? I’m going down there this
minute. (<em>Rises impetuously</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Rachel, for Heaven’s sake! No! I am entirely
too busy and tired today without being bothered
with a child romping around in here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Reluctantly and a trifle petulantly</em>): Very well,
then. (<em>For several moments she watches her mother,
who has begun to sew again. The displeasure vanishes
from her face</em>). Ma dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Is there anything wrong today?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: I’m just tired, chickabiddy, that’s all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Moves over to the table. Mechanically takes off
her hat and coat and carries them out into the entryway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
of the flat. She returns and goes to the looking glass
over the fireplace and tucks in the tendrils of her hair in
rather a preoccupied manner. The electric doorbell rings.
She returns to the speaking tube in the vestibule. Her
voice is heard answering</em>): Yes!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;No, I’m not
Mrs. Loving. She’s here, yes!&mdash;What? Oh! come right
up! (<em>Appearing in the doorway</em>). Ma dear, it’s some
man, who is coming for Mrs. Strong’s waist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Pausing and looking at Rachel</em>): It is probably
her son. She said she would send for it this afternoon.
(<em>Rachel disappears. A door is heard opening
and closing. There is the sound of a man’s voice. Rachel
ushers in Mr. John Strong.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Bowing pleasantly to Mrs. Loving</em>): Mrs. Loving?
(<em>Mrs. Loving bows, puts down her sewing, rises and goes
toward Strong</em>). My name is Strong. My mother asked
me to come by and get her waist this afternoon. She
hoped it would be finished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes, Mr. Strong, it is all ready. If you’ll sit
down a minute, I’ll wrap it up for you. (<em>She goes into
hallway leading to other rooms in flat</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Manifestly ill at ease at being left alone with a
stranger; attempting, however, to be the polite hostess</em>):
Do sit down, Mr. Strong. (<em>They both sit</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Nervously after a pause</em>): It’s a very pleasant
day, isn’t it, Mr. Strong?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Yes, very. (<em>He leans back composedly, his hat
on his knee, the faintest expression of amusement in his
eyes</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>After a pause</em>): It’s quite a climb up to our flat,
don’t you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Why, no! It didn’t strike me so. I’m not old
enough yet to mind stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: (<em>Nervously</em>): Oh! I didn’t mean that you are old!
Anyone can see you are quite young, that is, of course, not
too young, but,&mdash;(<em>Strong laughs quietly</em>). There! I
don’t blame you for laughing. I’m always clumsy just
like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Calling from the other room</em>): Rachel, bring
me a needle and the sixty cotton, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: All right, Ma dear! (<em>Rummages for the cotton
in the machine drawer, and upsets several spools upon the
floor. To Strong</em>): You see! I can’t even get a spool of
cotton without spilling things all over the floor. (<em>Strong
smiles, Rachel picks up the spools and finally gets the cotton
and needle</em>). Excuse me! (<em>Goes out door leading
to other rooms. Strong left to himself, looks around
casually. The “Golden Stairs” interests him and the
“Sistine Madonna.”</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Reenters, evidently continuing her function of
hostess</em>): We were talking about the climb to our flat,
weren’t we? You see, when you’re poor, you have to
live in a top flat. There is always a compensation, though;
we have bully&mdash;I mean nice air, better light, a lovely
view, and nobody “thud-thudding” up and down over our
heads night and day. The people below have our “thud-thudding,”
and it must be something <em>awful</em>, especially
when Tom and I play “Ivanhoe” and have a tournament
up here. We’re entirely too old, but we still play. Ma
dear rather dreads the climb up three flights, so Tom and
I do all the errands. We don’t mind climbing the stairs,
particularly when we go up two or three at a time,&mdash;that
is&mdash;Tom still does. I can’t, Ma dear stopped me.
(<em>Sighs</em>). I’ve got to grow up it seems.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Evidently amused</em>): It is rather hard being a girl,
isn’t it?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh, no! It’s not hard at all. That’s the trouble;
they won’t let me be a girl. I’d love to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Reentering with parcel. She smiles</em>): My
Chatterbox, I see, is entertaining you, Mr. Strong. I’m
sorry to have kept you waiting, but I forgot, I found, to
sew the ruching in the neck. I hope everything is satisfactory.
If it isn’t, I’ll be glad to make any changes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Who has risen upon her entrance</em>): Thank you,
Mrs. Loving, I’m sure everything is all right. (<em>He takes
the package and bows to her and Rachel. He moves

hair lightly and delicately here and there. Mrs. Loving
returns</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Still at the glass</em>): He <em>was</em> rather nice, wasn’t he,
Ma dear?&mdash;for a man? (<em>Laughs</em>). I guess my reason’s
a vain one,&mdash;he let me do all the talking. (<em>Pauses</em>).
Strong? Strong? Ma dear, is his mother the little woman
with the sad, black eyes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Resuming her sewing; sitting before the machine</em>).
Yes. I was rather curious, I confess, to see this
son of hers. The whole time I’m fitting her she talks of
nothing else. She worships him. (<em>Pauses</em>). It’s rather
a sad case, I believe. She is a widow. Her husband was
a doctor and left her a little money. She came up from
the South to educate this boy. Both of them worked
hard and the boy got through college. Three months he
hunted for work that a college man might expect to get.
You see he had the tremendous handicap of being colored.
As the two of them had to live, one day, without her
knowing it, he hired himself out as a waiter. He has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
one now for two years. He is evidently goodness itself
to his mother.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Slowly and thoughtfully</em>): Just because he is
<em>colored</em>! (<em>Pauses</em>). We sing a song at school, I believe,
about “The land of the free and the home of the brave.”
What an amusing nation it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Watching Rachel anxiously</em>): Come, Rachel,
you haven’t time for “amusing nations.” Remember, you
haven’t practised any this afternoon. And put your books
away; don’t leave them on the table. You didn’t practise
any this morning either, did you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, Ma dear,&mdash;didn’t wake up in time. (<em>Goes to
the table and in an abstracted manner puts books on the
bookcase; returns to the table; picks up the roll of sheet
music she has brought home with her; brightens; impulsively</em>)
Ma dear, just listen to this lullaby. It’s the sweetest
thing. I was so “daffy” over it, one of the girls at
school lent it to me. (<em>She rushes to the piano with the
music and plays the accompaniment through softly and
then sings, still softly and with great expression, Jessie
Gaynor’s “Slumber Boat”</em>)&mdash;</p>

if I believed that I should grow up and not be a mother,
I’d pray to die now. I’ve thought about it a lot, Ma dear,
and once I dreamed, and a voice said to me&mdash;oh! it was so
real&mdash;“Rachel, you are to be a mother to little children.”
Wasn’t that beautiful? Ever since I have known how
Mary felt at the “Annunciation.” (<em>Almost in a whisper</em>)

it has explained so much to me. I know now why I just
can’t resist any child. I have to love it&mdash;it calls me&mdash;it&mdash;draws

for it. I want the feel of its little warm body against
me, its breath on my neck, its hands against my face.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
(<em>Pauses thoughtfully for a few moments</em>). Ma dear,
here’s something I don’t understand: I love the little black
and brown babies best of all. There is something about
them that&mdash;that&mdash;clutches at my heart. Why&mdash;why&mdash;should
they be&mdash;oh!&mdash;pathetic? I don’t understand. It’s
dim. More than the other babies, I feel that I must protect
them. They’re in danger, but from what? I don’t
know. I’ve tried so hard to understand, but I can’t. (<em>Her
face radiant and beautiful</em>). Ma dear, I think their white
teeth and the clear whites of their big black eyes and their
dimples everywhere&mdash;are&mdash;are (<em>Breaks off</em>). And, Ma
dear, because I love them best, I pray God every night to
give me, when I grow up, little black and brown babies&mdash;to
protect and guard. (<em>Wistfully</em>). Now, Ma dear,
don’t you see why you must never laugh at me again?

Rachel. Life is not terrible when there are little children&mdash;and
you&mdash;and Tom&mdash;and a roof over our heads&mdash;and
work&mdash;and food&mdash;and clothes&mdash;and sleep at night.
(<em>Pauses</em>). Rachel, I am not myself today. I’m tired.

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: I hope you got that “capital,” Rachel. How’s that for
Latin knowledge? Eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I don’t think much of your knowledge, Tommy
dear; but (<em>continuing to chant</em>) Our Tommy’s on the
team! Our Tommy’s on the team! Our&mdash;(<em>Breaks
off</em>). I’ve a good mind to kiss you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Threateningly</em>): Don’t you dare.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Rising and going toward him</em>): I will! I will! I
will!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Rising, too, and dodging her</em>): No, you don’t, young
lady. (<em>A tremendous tussle and scuffle ensues</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): For Heaven’s sake! children, do
stop playing and eat your supper. (<em>They nod brightly
at each other behind her back and return smiling to the
table</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Sticking out her tongue at Tom</em>): I will!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Mimicking her</em>): You won’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Children! (<em>They eat for a time in silence</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Ma dear, have you noticed Mary Shaw doesn’t
come here much these days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Why, that’s so, she doesn’t. Have you two
quarreled?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, Ma dear. (<em>Uncomfortably</em>). I&mdash;think I
know the reason&mdash;but I don’t like to say, unless I’m certain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Well, I know. I’ve seen her lately with those two
girls who have just come from the South. Twice she
bowed stiffly, and the last time made believe she didn’t see
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Then you think&mdash;? Oh! I was afraid it was that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Bitterly</em>): Yes&mdash;we’re “niggers”&mdash;that’s why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Slowly and sadly</em>): Rachel, that’s one of the
things I can’t save you from. I worried considerably
about Mary, at first&mdash;you do take your friendships so
seriously. I knew exactly how it would end. (<em>Pauses</em>).
And then I saw that if Mary Shaw didn’t teach you the
lesson&mdash;some one else would. They don’t want you,
dearies, when you and they grow up. You may have
everything in your favor&mdash;but they don’t <em>dare</em> to like you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I know all that is generally true&mdash;but I had hoped
that Mary&mdash;(<em>Breaks off</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Well, I guess we can still go on living even if people
don’t speak to us. I’ll never bow to <em>her</em> again&mdash;that’s
certain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: But, Son, that wouldn’t be polite, if she bowed
to you first.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Can’t help it. I guess I can be blind, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Wearily</em>): Well&mdash;perhaps you are right&mdash;I
don’t know. It’s the way I feel about it too&mdash;but&mdash;but
I wish my son always to be a <em>gentleman</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: If being a <em>gentleman</em> means not being a <em>man</em>&mdash;I don’t
wish to be one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh! well, perhaps we’re wrong about Mary&mdash;I
hope we are. (<em>Sighs</em>). Anyway, let’s forget it. Tommy
guess what I’ve got. (<em>Rises, goes out into entryway
swiftly, and returns holding up a small bag</em>). Ma dear
treated. Guess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Ma, you’re a thoroughbred. Well, let’s see&mdash;it’s&mdash;a
dozen dill pickles?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh! stop fooling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: I’m not. Tripe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Silly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Hog’s jowl?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Ugh! Give it up&mdash;quarter-back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Pig’s feet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>In pretended disgust</em>): Oh! Ma dear&mdash;send him
from the table. It’s CANDY!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Candy? Funny, I never thought of that! And I was
just about to say some nice, delicious chitlings. Candy!
Well! Well! (<em>Rachel disdainfully carries the candy to
her mother, returns to her own seat with the bag and helps
herself. She ignores Tom</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>In an aggrieved voice</em>): You see, Ma, how she treats
me. (<em>In affected tones</em>) I have a good mind, young lady
to punish you, er&mdash;er corporeally speaking. Tut! Tut!
I have a mind to master thee&mdash;I mean&mdash;you. Methinks
that if I should advance upon you, apply, perchance, two
or three digits to your glossy locks and extract&mdash;aha!&mdash;say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
a strand&mdash;you would no more defy me. (<em>He starts
to rise</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Quickly and sharply</em>): Rachel! give Tom the
candy and stop playing. (<em>Rachel obeys. They eat in
silence. The old depression returns. When the candy
is all gone, Rachel pushes her chair back, and is just about
to rise, when her mother, who is very evidently nerving
herself for something, stops her</em>). Just a moment, Rachel.
(<em>Pauses, continuing slowly and very seriously</em>).
Tom and Rachel! I have been trying to make up my mind
for some time whether a certain thing is my duty or not.
Today&mdash;I have decided it is. You are old enough,
now,&mdash;and I see you ought to be told. Do you know
what day this is? (<em>Both Tom and Rachel have been
watching their mother intently</em>). It’s the sixteenth of
October. Does that mean anything to either of you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Wonderingly</em>): No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Looking at both of them thoughtfully, half
to herself</em>): No&mdash;I don’t know why it should. (<em>Slowly</em>)
Ten years ago&mdash;today&mdash;your father and your half-brother
died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: I do remember, now, that you told us it was in October.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>With a sigh</em>): That explains&mdash;today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes, Rachel. (<em>Pauses</em>). Do you know&mdash;how
they&mdash;died?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Why, no.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Did it ever strike you as strange&mdash;that they&mdash;died&mdash;the
same day?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Well, yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: We often wondered, Tom and I; but&mdash;but somehow
we never quite dared to ask you. You&mdash;you&mdash;always
refused to talk about them, you know, Ma dear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Did you think&mdash;that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;the reason&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;wouldn’t
talk about them&mdash;was&mdash;because, because&mdash;I
was ashamed&mdash;of them? (<em>Tom and Rachel look uncomfortable</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, Ma dear&mdash;we&mdash;we&mdash;did&mdash;wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Questioningly</em>): And you thought?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Haltingly</em>): W-e-l-l&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Sharply</em>): Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Oh! come, now, Rachel, you know we haven’t
bothered about it at all. Why should we? We’ve been
happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: But when you have thought&mdash;you’ve been
ashamed? (<em>Intensely</em>) Have you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Now, Ma, aren’t you making a lot out of nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Slowly</em>): No. (<em>Half to herself</em>) You evade&mdash;both&mdash;of
you. You <em>have</em> been ashamed. And I never
dreamed until today you <em>could</em> take it this way. How
blind&mdash;how almost criminally blind, I have been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Tremulously</em>): Oh! Ma dear, don’t! (<em>Tom and
Rachel watch their mother anxiously and uncomfortably.
Mrs. Loving is very evidently nerving herself for something</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Very slowly, with restrained emotion</em>): Tom&mdash;and
Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Ma!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Ma dear! (<em>A tense, breathless pause</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Bracing herself</em>): They&mdash;they&mdash;were
lynched!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> and <span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>In a whisper</em>): Lynched!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Slowly, laboring under strong but restrained
emotion</em>): Yes&mdash;by Christian people&mdash;in a Christian land.
We found out afterwards they were all church members
in good standing&mdash;the best people. (<em>A silence</em>). Your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
father was a man among men. He was a fanatic. He
was a Saint!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Breathing with difficulty</em>): Ma&mdash;can you&mdash;will you&mdash;tell
us&mdash;about it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: I believe it to be my duty. (<em>A silence</em>).
When I married your father I was a widow. My little
George was seven years old. From the very beginning he
worshiped your father. He followed him around&mdash;just
like a little dog. All children were like that with him. I
myself have never seen anybody like him. “Big” seems
to fit him better than any other word. He was big-bodied&mdash;big-souled.
His loves were big and his
hates. You can imagine, then, how the wrongs of the
Negro&mdash;ate into his soul. (<em>Pauses</em>). He was utterly
fearless. (<em>A silence</em>). He edited and owned, for several
years, a small negro paper. In it he said a great many
daring things. I used to plead with him to be more careful.
I was always afraid for him. For a long time, nothing
happened&mdash;he was too important to the community.
And then&mdash;one night&mdash;ten years ago&mdash;a mob made up of
the respectable people in the town lynched an innocent
black man&mdash;and what was worse&mdash;they knew him to be
innocent. A white man was guilty. I never saw your
father so wrought up over anything: he couldn’t eat; he
couldn’t sleep; he brooded night and day over it. And
then&mdash;realizing fully the great risk he was running, although
I begged him not to&mdash;and all his friends also&mdash;he
deliberately and calmly went to work and published a
most terrific denunciation of that mob. The old prophets
in the Bible were not more terrible than he. A day or
two later, he received an anonymous letter, very evidently
from an educated man, calling upon him to retract his
words in the next issue. If he refused his life was
threatened. The next week’s issue contained an arraignment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
as frightful, if not more so, than the previous one.
Each word was white-hot, searing. That night, some
dozen masked men came to our house.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Moaning</em>): Oh, Ma dear! Ma dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Too absorbed to hear</em>): We were not asleep&mdash;your
father and I. They broke down the front door
and made their way to our bedroom. Your father kissed
me&mdash;and took up his revolver. It was always loaded.
They broke down the door. (<em>A silence. She continues
slowly and quietly</em>) I tried to shut my eyes&mdash;I could not.
Four masked men fell&mdash;they did not move any more&mdash;after
a little. (<em>Pauses</em>). Your father was finally overpowered
and dragged out. In the hall&mdash;my little seventeen-year-old
George tried to rescue him. Your father
begged him not to interfere. He paid no attention. It
ended in their dragging them both out. (<em>Pauses</em>). My
little George&mdash;was&mdash;a man! (<em>Controls herself with an
effort</em>). He never made an outcry. His last words to
me were: “Ma, I am glad to go with Father.” I could
only nod to him. (<em>Pauses</em>). While they were dragging
them down the steps, I crept into the room where you
were. You were both asleep. Rachel, I remember, was
smiling. I knelt down by you&mdash;and covered my ears with
my hands&mdash;and waited. I could not pray&mdash;I couldn’t for
a long time&mdash;afterwards. (<em>A silence</em>). It was very still
when I finally uncovered my ears. The only sounds were
the faint rustle of leaves and the “tap-tapping of the twig
of a tree” against the window. I hear it still&mdash;sometimes
in my dreams. <em>It was the tree&mdash;where they were.</em> (<em>A
silence</em>). While I had knelt there waiting&mdash;I had made
up my mind what to do. I dressed myself and then I
woke you both up and dressed you. (<em>Pauses</em>). We set
forth. It was a black, still night. Alternately dragging
you along and carrying you&mdash;I walked five miles to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
house of some friends. They took us in, and we remained
there until I had seen my dead laid comfortably at rest.
They lent me money to come North&mdash;I couldn’t bring you
up&mdash;in the South. (<em>A silence</em>). Always remember this:
There never lived anywhere&mdash;or at any time&mdash;any two
whiter or more beautiful souls. God gave me one for a
husband and one for a son and I am proud. (<em>Brokenly</em>)
You&mdash;must&mdash;be&mdash;proud&mdash;too. (<em>A long silence. Mrs.
Loving bows her head in her hands. Tom controls himself
with an effort. Rachel creeps softly to her mother,
kneels beside her and lifts the hem of her dress to her
lips. She does not dare touch her. She adores her with
her eyes</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Presently raising her head and glancing at
the clock</em>): Tom, it’s time, now, for you to go to work.
Rachel and I will finish up here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Still laboring under great emotion goes out into the
entryway and comes back and stands in the doorway with
his cap. He twirls it around and around nervously</em>): I
want you to know, Ma, before I go&mdash;how&mdash;how proud I
am. Why, I didn’t believe two people could be like that&mdash;and
live. And then to find out that one&mdash;was your
own father&mdash;and one&mdash;your own brother.&mdash;It’s wonderful!
I’m&mdash;not much yet, Ma, but&mdash;I’ve&mdash;I’ve just got to
be something now. (<em>Breaks off</em>). (<em>His face becomes
distorted with passion and hatred</em>). When I think&mdash;when
I think&mdash;of those devils with white skins&mdash;living
somewhere today&mdash;living and happy&mdash;I&mdash;see&mdash;red! I&mdash;I&mdash;good-bye!
(<em>Rushes out, the door bangs</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Half to herself</em>): I was afraid&mdash;of just that.
I wonder&mdash;if I did the wise thing&mdash;after all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>With a gesture infinitely tender, puts her arms
around her mother</em>): Yes, Ma dear, you did. And, hereafter,
Tom and I share and share alike with you. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
think, Ma dear, of ten years of this&mdash;all alone. It’s
wicked! (<em>A short silence</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: And, Rachel, about that dear, little boy,
Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Now, Ma dear, tell me tomorrow. You’ve stood
enough for one day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: No, it’s better over and done with&mdash;all at
once. If I had seen that dear child suddenly any other
day than this&mdash;I might have borne it better. When he
lifted his little face to me&mdash;and smiled&mdash;for a moment&mdash;I
thought it was the end&mdash;of all things. Rachel, he is the
image of my boy&mdash;my George!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Ma dear!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: And, Rachel&mdash;it will hurt&mdash;to see him again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I understand, Ma dear. (<em>A silence. Suddenly</em>)
Ma dear, I am beginning to see&mdash;to understand&mdash;so much.
(<em>Slowly and thoughtfully</em>) Ten years ago, all things being
equal, Jimmy might have been&mdash;George? Isn’t that so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Why&mdash;yes, if I understand you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I guess that doesn’t sound very clear. It’s only
getting clear to me, little by little. Do you mind my
thinking out loud to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: No, chickabiddy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: If Jimmy went South now&mdash;and grew up&mdash;he
might be&mdash;a George?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Then, the South is full of tens, hundreds, thousands
of little boys, who, one day may be&mdash;and some of
them with certainty&mdash;Georges?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes, Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: And the little babies, the dear, little, helpless
babies, being born today&mdash;now&mdash;and those who will be,
tomorrow, and all the tomorrows to come&mdash;have <em>that</em>
sooner or later to look forward to? They will laugh and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
play and sing and be happy and grow up, perhaps, and be
ambitious&mdash;just for <em>that</em>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes, Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Then, everywhere, everywhere, throughout the
South, there are hundreds of dark mothers who live in
fear, terrible, suffocating fear, whose rest by night is
broken, and whose joy by day in their babies on their
hearts is three parts&mdash;pain. Oh, I know this is true&mdash;for
this is the way I should feel, if I were little Jimmy’s
mother. How horrible! Why&mdash;it would be more merciful&mdash;to
strangle the little things at birth. And so this
nation&mdash;this white Christian nation&mdash;has deliberately set
its curse upon the most beautiful&mdash;the most holy thing in
life&mdash;motherhood! Why&mdash;it&mdash;makes&mdash;you doubt&mdash;God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Oh, hush! little girl. Hush!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Suddenly with a great cry</em>): Why, Ma dear, <em>you
know. You were a mother, George’s mother.</em> So, this is
what it means. Oh, Ma dear! Ma dear! (<em>Faints in
her mother’s arms</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <em>October sixteenth, four years later; seven o’clock in
the morning</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene</span>: <em>The same room. There have been very evident
improvements made. The room is not so bare; it is
cosier. On the shelf, before each window, are potted
red geraniums. At the windows are green denim drapery
curtains covering fresh white dotted Swiss inner
curtains. At each doorway are green denim portieres.
On the wall between the kitchenette and the entrance
to the outer rooms of the flat, a new picture is hanging,
Millet’s “The Man With the Hoe.” Hanging against
the side of the run that faces front is Watts’s “Hope.”
There is another easy-chair at the left front. The table
in the center is covered with a white table-cloth. A
small asparagus fern is in the middle of this. When
the curtain rises there is the clatter of dishes in the
kitchenette. Presently Rachel enters with dishes and
silver in her hands. She is clad in a bungalow apron.
She is noticeably all of four years older. She frowns
as she sets the table. There is a set expression about
the mouth. A child’s voice is heard from the rooms
within.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Still unseen</em>): Ma Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Pauses and smiles</em>): What is it, Jimmy boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Appearing in rear doorway, half-dressed, breathless
and tremendously excited over something. Rushes
toward Rachel</em>): Three guesses! Three guesses! Ma
Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Her whole face softening</em>): Well, let’s see&mdash;maybe
there is a circus in town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: No siree! (<em>In a sing-song</em>) You’re not right!
You’re not right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, maybe Ma Loving’s going to take you
somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: No! (<em>Vigorously shaking his head</em>) It’s&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Interrupting quickly</em>): You said I could have three
guesses, honey. I’ve only had two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: I thought you had three. How many are three?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Counting on her fingers</em>): One! Two! Three!
I’ve only had one! two!&mdash;See? Perhaps Uncle Tom
is going to give you some candy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Dancing up and down</em>): No! No! No!
(<em>Catches his breath</em>) I leaned over the bath-tub, way
over, and got hold of the chain with the button on the
end, and dropped it into the little round place in the
bottom. And then I runned lots and lots of water in the
tub and climbed over and fell in splash! just like a big
stone; (<em>Loudly</em>) and took a bath all by myself alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Laughing and hugging him</em>): All by yourself,
honey? You ran the water, too, boy, not “runned” it.
What I want to know is, where was Ma Loving all this
time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: I stole in “creepy-creep” and looked at Ma Loving
and she was awful fast asleep. (<em>Proudly</em>) Ma Rachel,
I’m a “nawful,” big boy now, aren’t I? I are almost a
man, aren’t I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh! Boy, I’m getting tired of correcting you&mdash;“I
am almost a man, am I not?” Jimmy, boy, what will Ma
Rachel do, if you grow up? Why, I won’t have a little
boy any more! Honey, you mustn’t grow up, do you
hear? You mustn’t.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Oh, yes, I must; and you’ll have me just the same,
Ma Rachel. I’m going to be a policeman and make lots
of money for you and Ma Loving and Uncle Tom, and
I’m going to buy you some trains and fire-engines, and
little, cunning ponies, and some rabbits, and some great
’normous banks full of money&mdash;lots of it. And then, we
are going to live in a great, big castle and eat lots of ice
cream, all the time, and drink lots and lots of nice pink
lemonade.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: What a generous Jimmy boy! (<em>Hugs him</em>). Before
I give you “morning kiss,” I must see how clean my
boy is. (<em>Inspects teeth, ears and neck</em>). Jimmy, you’re

look at those nails! Oh! Jimmy! (<em>Jimmy wriggles and
tries to get his hands away</em>). Honey, get my file off of
my bureau and go to Ma Loving; she must be awake by
this time. Why, honey, what’s the matter with your
feet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: I don’t know. I thought they looked kind of
queer, myself. What’s the matter with them?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): You have your shoes on the wrong
feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Bursts out laughing</em>): Isn’t that most ’normously
funny? I’m a case, aren’t I&mdash;(<em>pauses thoughtfully</em>) I
mean&mdash;am I not, Ma Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes, honey, a great big case of molasses. Come,
you must hurry now, and get dressed. You don’t want
to be late for school, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Ma Rachel! (<em>Shyly</em>) I&mdash;I have been making something
for you all the morning&mdash;ever since I waked up.
It’s awful nice. It’s&mdash;stoop down, Ma Rachel, please&mdash;a
great, big (<em>puts both arms about her neck and gives
her a noisy kiss. Rachel kisses him in return, then pushes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
his head back. For a long moment they look at each
other; and, then, laughing joyously, he makes believe he
is a horse, and goes prancing out of the room. Rachel,
with a softer, gentler expression, continues setting the
table. Presently, Mrs. Loving, bent and worn-looking,
appears in the doorway in the rear. She limps a trifle.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Good morning, dearie. How’s my little girl,
this morning? (<em>Looks around the room</em>). Why, where’s
Tom? I was certain I heard him running the water in
the tub, sometime ago. (<em>Limps into the room</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): Tom isn’t up yet. Have you seen
Jimmy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Jimmy? No. I didn’t know he was awake,
even.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Going to her mother and kissing her</em>): Well!
What do you think of that! I sent the young gentleman
to you, a few minutes ago, for help with his nails. He
is very much grown up this morning, so I suppose that
explains why he didn’t come to you. Yesterday, all day,
you know, he was a puppy. No one knows what he will
be by tomorrow. All of this, Ma dear, is preliminary to
telling you that Jimmy boy has stolen a march on you,
this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Stolen a march! How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: It appears that he took his bath all by himself
and, as a result, he is so conceited, peacocks aren’t in it
with him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: I heard the water running and thought, of
course, it was Tom. Why, the little rascal! I must go
and see how he has left things. I was just about to wake
him up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Rheumatism’s not much better this morning, Ma
dear. (<em>Confronting her mother</em>). Tell me the truth, now,
did you or did you not try that liniment I bought you yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Guiltily</em>): Well, Rachel, you see&mdash;it was this
way, I was&mdash;I was so tired, last night,&mdash;I&mdash;I really forgot
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I thought as much. Shame on you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: As soon as I walk around a bit it will be all
right. It always is. It’s bad, when I first get up&mdash;that’s
all. I’ll be spry enough in a few minutes. (<em>Limps to
the door; pauses</em>) Rachel, I don’t know why the thought
should strike me, but how very strangely things turn out.
If any one had told me four years ago that Jimmy would
be living with us, I should have laughed at him. Then it
hurt to see him; now it would hurt not to. (<em>Softly</em>)
Rachel, sometimes&mdash;I wonder&mdash;if, perhaps, God&mdash;hasn’t
relented a little&mdash;and given me back my boy,&mdash;my George.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: The whole thing was strange, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes, God’s ways are strange and often very
beautiful; perhaps all would be beautiful&mdash;if we only understood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: God’s ways are certainly very mysterious. Why,
of all the people in this apartment-house, should Jimmy’s
father and mother be the only two to take the smallpox,
and the only two to die. It’s queer!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: It doesn’t seem like two years ago, does it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Two years, Ma dear! Why it’s three the third of
January.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Are you sure, Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Gently</em>): I don’t believe I could ever forget that,
Ma dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: No, I suppose not. That is one of the differences
between youth and old age&mdash;youth attaches tremendous
importance to dates,&mdash;old age does not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Quickly</em>): Ma dear, don’t talk like that. You’re
not old.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Oh! yes, I am, dearie. It’s sixty long years
since I was born; and I am much older than that, much
older.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Please, Ma dear, please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Smiling</em>): Very well, dearie, I won’t say it
any more. (<em>A pause</em>). By the way,&mdash;how&mdash;does Tom
strike you, these days?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Avoiding her mother’s eye</em>): The same old, bantering,
cheerful Tom. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: I know he’s all that, dearie, but it isn’t possible
for him to be really cheerful. (<em>Pauses; goes on
wistfully</em>) When you are little, we mothers can kiss away
all the trouble, but when you grow up&mdash;and go out&mdash;into
the world&mdash;and get hurt&mdash;we are helpless. There is nothing
we can do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Don’t worry about Tom, Ma dear, he’s game. He
doesn’t show the white feather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Did you see him, when he came in, last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Had he had&mdash;any luck?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No. (<em>Firmly</em>) Ma dear, we may as well face it&mdash;it’s
hopeless, I’m afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: I’m afraid&mdash;you are right. (<em>Shakes her head
sadly</em>) Well, I’ll go and see how Jimmy has left things
and wake up Tom, if he isn’t awake yet. It’s the waking
up in the mornings that’s hard. (<em>Goes limping out rear
door. Rachel frowns as she continues going back and
forth between the kitchenette and the table. Presently
Tom appears in the door at the rear. He watches Rachel
several moments before he speaks or enters. Rachel looks
grim enough</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Entering and smiling</em>): Good-morning, “Merry Sunshine”!
Have you, perhaps, been taking a&mdash;er&mdash;prolonged
draught of that very delightful beverage&mdash;vinegar?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
(<em>Rachel, with a knife in her hand, looks up unsmiling.
In pretended fright</em>) I take it all back, I’m sure.
May I request, humbly, that before I press my chaste,
morning salute upon your forbidding lips, that you&mdash;that
you&mdash;that you&mdash;er&mdash;in some way rid yourself of that&mdash;er&mdash;knife?
(<em>Bows as Rachel puts it down</em>). I thank
you. (<em>He comes to her and tips her head back; gently</em>)
What’s the matter with my little Sis?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Her face softening</em>): Tommy dear, don’t mind me.
I’m getting wicked, I guess. At present I feel just like&mdash;&mdash; like
curdled milk. Once upon a time, I used to have
quite a nice disposition, didn’t I, Tommy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Smiling</em>): Did you, indeed! I’m not going to flatter
you. Well, brace yourself, old lady. Ready, One! Two!
Three! Go! (<em>Kisses her, then puts his hands on either
side of her face, and raising it, looks down into it</em>).
You’re a pretty, decent little sister, Sis, that’s what T.
Loving thinks about it; and he knows a thing or two.
(<em>Abruptly looking around</em>) Has the paper come yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I haven’t looked, it must have, though, by this
time. (<em>Tom, hands in his pockets, goes into the vestibule.
He whistles. The outer door opens and closes, and presently
he saunters back, newspaper in hand. He lounges
carelessly in the arm-chair and looks at Rachel</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: May T. Loving be of any service to you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Service! How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: May he run, say, any errands, set the table, cook the
breakfast? Anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Watching the lazy figure</em>): You look like working.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Grinning</em>): It’s at least&mdash;polite&mdash;to offer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: You can’t do anything; I don’t trust you to do it
right. You may just sit there, and read your paper&mdash;and
try to behave yourself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>In affectedly meek tones</em>): Thank you, ma’am.
(<em>Opens the paper, but does not read. Jimmy presently
enters riding around the table on a cane. Rachel peeps in
from the kitchenette and smiles. Tom puts down his
paper</em>). ’Lo! Big Fellow, what’s this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Disgustedly</em>): How can I hear? I’m miles and
miles away yet. (<em>Prances around and around the room;
presently stops near Tom, attempting a gruff voice</em>) Good-morning!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Lowering his paper again</em>): Bless my stars! Who’s
this? Well, if it isn’t Mr. Mason! How&mdash;do&mdash;you&mdash;do, Mr.
Mason? That’s a beautiful horse you have there. He
limps a trifle in his left, hind, front foot, though.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: He doesn’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: He does!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Fiercely</em>): He doesn’t!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>As fiercely</em>): I say he does!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Appearing in the doorway in the rear</em>): For
Heaven’s sake! What is this? Good-morning, Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Rising and going toward his mother, Jimmy following
astride of the cane in his rear</em>): Good-morning, Ma.
(<em>Kisses her; lays his head on her shoulder and makes
believe he is crying; in a high falsetto</em>) Ma! Jimmy says
his horse doesn’t limp in his hind, front right leg, and I
say he does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Throws his cane aside, rolls on the floor and kicks
up his heels. He roars with laughter</em>): I think Uncle
Tom is funnier than any clown in the “Kickus.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Raising his head and looking down at Jimmy; Rachel
stands in the kitchenette doorway</em>): In the <em>what</em>, Jimmy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: In the “kickus,” of course.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: “Kickus”! “Kickus”! Oh, Lordy! (<em>Tom and Rachel
shriek with laughter; Mrs. Loving looks amused;
Jimmy, very much affronted, gets upon his feet again.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
Tom leans over and swings Jimmy high in the air</em>). Boy,
you’ll be the death of me yet. Circus, son! Circus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>From on high, soberly and with injured dignity</em>):
Well, I thinks “Kickus” and circus are very much alike.
Please put me down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>From the doorway</em>): We laugh, honey, because
we love you so much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Somewhat mollified, to Tom</em>): Is that so, Uncle
Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Surest thing in the world! (<em>Severely</em>) Come, get
down, young man. Don’t you know you’ll wear my arms
out? Besides, there is something in my lower vest pocket,
that’s just dying to come to you. Get down, I say.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): How can I get down? (<em>Wriggles
around</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: How should I know? Just get down, of course.
(<em>Very suddenly puts Jimmy down on his feet. Jimmy
tries to climb up over him</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Please sit down, Uncle Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>In feigned surprise</em>): Sit down! What for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Pummeling him with his little fists, loudly</em>): Why,
you said there was something for me in your pocket.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Sitting down</em>): So I did. How forgetful I am!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Finding a bright, shiny penny, shrieks</em>): Oh! Oh!
Oh! (<em>Climbs up and kisses Tom noisily</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Why, Jimmy! You embarrass me. My! My!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: What is ’barrass?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: You make me blush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Come, come, children! Rachel has the
breakfast on the table. (<em>Tom sits in Jimmy’s place and
Jimmy tries to drag him out</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: What’s the matter, now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: You’re in <em>my</em> place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Well, can’t you sit in mine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Wistfully</em>): I wants to sit by my Ma Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Well, so do I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Tom, stop teasing Jimmy. Honey, don’t you let
him bother you; ask him please prettily.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Please prettily, Uncle Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Oh! well then. (<em>Gets up and takes his own place.
They sit as they did in Act I. only Jimmy sits between
Tom, at the end, and Rachel</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Loudly</em>): Oh, goody! goody! goody! We’ve got
sau-sa-ges.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Sh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Silenced for a few moments; Rachel ties a big
napkin around his neck, and prepares his breakfast. He
breaks forth again suddenly and excitedly</em>): Uncle Tom!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: I took a bath this morning, all by myself alone, in
the bath-tub, and I ranned, no (<em>Doubtfully</em>) I runned, I
think&mdash;the water all in it, and got in it all by myself; and
Ma Loving thought it was you; but it was <em>me</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>In feignedly severe tones</em>): See here, young man, this
won’t do. Don’t you know I’m the only one who is
allowed to do that here? It’s a perfect waste of water&mdash;that’s
what it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Undaunted</em>): Oh! no, you’re not the only one,
’cause Ma Loving and Ma Rachel and me&mdash;alls takes
baths every single morning. So, there!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: You ’barrass me. (<em>Jimmy opens his mouth to ask a
question; Tom quickly</em>) Young gentleman, your mouth is
open. Close it, sir; close it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Tom, you’re as big a child exactly as Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Bowing to right and left</em>): You compliment me. I
thank you, I am sure.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>They finish in silence.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Sighing with contentment</em>): I’m through, Ma
Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Jimmy, you’re a big boy, now, aren’t you?
(<em>Jimmy nods his head vigorously and looks proud.</em>) I
wonder if you’re big enough to wash your own hands,
this morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Shrilly</em>): Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Well, if they’re beautifully clean, I’ll give you
another penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Excitedly to Rachel</em>): Please untie my napkin, Ma
Rachel! (<em>Rachel does so.</em>) “Excoose” me, please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving and Rachel</span>: Certainly. (<em>Jimmy climbs
down and rushes out at the rear doorway.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Solemnly and slowly; breaking the silence</em>):
Rachel, do you know what day this is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Looking at her plate; slowly</em>): Yes, Ma dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Grimly and slowly</em>): Yes, Ma.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>A silence.</em>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Impressively</em>): We must never&mdash;as long&mdash;as
we live&mdash;forget this day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, Ma dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: No, Ma.</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(<em>Another silence.</em>)</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Slowly; as though thinking aloud</em>): I hear people
talk about God’s justice&mdash;and I wonder. There, are you,
Ma. There isn’t a sacrifice&mdash;that you haven’t made.
You’re still working your fingers to the bone&mdash;sewing&mdash;just
so all of us may keep on living. Rachel is a graduate
in Domestic Science; she was high in her class; most
of the girls below her in rank have positions in the
schools. I’m an electrical engineer&mdash;and I’ve tried
steadily for several months&mdash;to practice my profession.
It seems our educations aren’t of much use to us: we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
aren’t allowed to make good&mdash;because our skins are dark.
(<em>Pauses</em>) And, in the South today, there are white men&mdash;(<em>Controls
himself</em>). They have everything; they’re
well-dressed, well-fed, well-housed; they’re prosperous in
business; they’re important politically; they’re pillars in
the church. I know all this is true&mdash;I’ve inquired.
Their children (our ages, some of them) are growing up
around them; and they are having a square deal handed
out to them&mdash;college, position, wealth, and best of all,
freedom, without galling restrictions, to work out their
own salvations. With ability, they may become&mdash;anything;
and all this will be true of their children’s
children after them. (<em>A pause</em>). Look at us&mdash;and look
at them. We are destined to failure&mdash;they, to success.
Their children shall grow up in hope; ours, in despair.
Our hands are clean;&mdash;theirs are red with blood&mdash;red
with the blood of a noble man&mdash;and a boy. They’re
nothing but low, cowardly, bestial murderers. The scum
of the earth shall succeed.&mdash;God’s justice, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Rising and going to Tom; brokenly</em>): Tom,
promise me&mdash;one thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Rises gently</em>): What is it, Ma?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: That&mdash;you’ll try&mdash;not to lose faith&mdash;in God.
I’ve been where you are now&mdash;and it’s black. Tom, we
don’t understand God’s ways. My son, I know, now&mdash;He
is beautiful. Tom, won’t you try to believe, again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Slowly, but not convincingly</em>): I’ll try, Ma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Sighs</em>): Each one, I suppose, has to work
out his own salvation. (<em>After a pause</em>) Rachel, if you’ll
get Jimmy ready, I’ll take him to school. I’ve got to go
down town shopping for a customer, this morning. (<em>Rachel
rises and goes out the rear doorway; Mrs. Loving,

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>From within</em>): A yard, you say, Rachel?
You’re sure that will be enough. Oh! you’ve measured
it. Anything else?&mdash;What?&mdash;Oh! all right. I’ll be back
by one o’clock, anyway. Good-bye. (<em>Enters with
Jimmy. Both are dressed for the street. Tom looks up

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Hello! Big Fellow, where are you taking <em>my</em> mother,
I’d like to know? This is a pretty kettle of fish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): Aren’t you funny, Uncle Tom! Why,
I’m not taking her anywhere. She’s taking me. (<em>Importantly</em>)
I’m going to school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Big Fellow, come here. (<em>Jimmy comes with a rush</em>).
Now, where’s that penny I gave you? No, I don’t want
to see it. All right. Did Ma Loving give you another?
(<em>Vigorous noddings of the head from Jimmy</em>). I wish
you to promise me solemnly&mdash;Now, listen! Here, don’t
wriggle so! not to buy&mdash;Listen! too many pints of ice-cream
with my penny. Understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Very seriously</em>): Yes, Uncle Tom, cross my “tummy”!
I promise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Well, then, you may go. I guess that will be all for
the present. (<em>Jimmy loiters around looking up wistfully

something?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Grabbing at his pockets</em>): Bless my stars! what now?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: If you could kind of lean over this way. (<em>Tom
leans forward</em>). No, not that way. (<em>Tom leans toward
the side away from Jimmy</em>). No, this way, this way!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
(<em>Laughs and pummels him with his little fists</em>). This
way!</p>

so, at first?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Puts his arms around Tom’s neck and kisses him</em>):
Good-bye, dear old Uncle Tom. (<em>Tom catches him and

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Much affected, but with restraint, rising</em>): Thank
you&mdash;Good-bye. (<em>Mrs. Loving and Jimmy go out through
the vestibule. Tom lights a cigarette and tries to read
the paper. He soon sinks into a brown study. Presently

go. (<em>Rises leisurely and goes out into the vestibule. The

Tom and John Strong enter. During the ensuing conversation
Rachel finishes clearing the table, takes the
fern off, puts on the green table-cloth, places a doily carefully
in the centre, and replaces the fern. She apparently
pays no attention to the conversation between her brother

then</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Brightly</em>): Well, stranger, how does it happen
you’re out so early in the morning?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I hadn’t seen any of you for a week, and I thought
I’d come by, on my way to work, and find out how things
are going. There is no need of asking how you are, Rachel.
And the mother and the boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Ma dear’s rheumatism still holds on.&mdash;Jimmy’s
fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I’m sorry to hear that your mother is not well.
There isn’t a remedy going that my mother doesn’t know
about. I’ll get her advice and let you know. (<em>Turning
to Tom</em>) Well, Tom, how goes it? (<em>Strong and Tom
sit</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Smiling grimly</em>): There’s plenty of “go,” but no “git
there.”</p>

<p class="right p0">(<em>There is a pause</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I was hoping for better news.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: If I remember rightly, not so many years ago, you
tried&mdash;and failed. Then, a colored man had hardly a
ghost of a show;&mdash;now he hasn’t even the ghost of a ghost.
(<em>Rachel has finished and goes into the kitchenette</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: That’s true enough. (<em>A pause</em>). What are you
going to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Slowly</em>): I’ll do this little “going act” of mine the rest
of the week; (<em>pauses</em>) and then, I’ll do anything I can get
to do. If necessary, I suppose, I can be a “White-wing.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Tom, I came&mdash;(<em>Breaks off; continuing slowly</em>)
Six years ago, I found I was up against a stone wall&mdash;your
experience, you see, to the letter. I couldn’t let my
mother starve, so I became a waiter. (<em>Pauses</em>). I
studied waiting; I made a science of it, an art. In a comparatively
short time, I’m a head-waiter and I’m up
against another stonewall. I’ve reached my limit. I’m
thirty-two now, and I’ll die a head-waiter. (<em>A pause</em>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
College friends, so-called, and acquaintances used to come
into the restaurant. One or two at first&mdash;attempted to
commiserate with me. They didn’t do it again. I waited
upon them&mdash;I did my best. Many of them tipped me.
(<em>Pauses and smiles grimly</em>). I can remember my first
tip, still. They come in yet; many of them are already
powers, not only in this city, but in the country. Some
of them make a personal request that I wait upon them. I
am an artist, now, in my proper sphere. They tip me well,
extremely well&mdash;the larger the tip, the more pleased they
are with me. Because of me, in their own eyes, they’re
philanthropists. Amusing, isn’t it? I can stand their attitude
now. My philosophy&mdash;learned hard, is to make
the best of everything you can, and go on. At best, life
isn’t so very long. You’re wondering why I’m telling
you all this. I wish you to see things exactly as they are.
There are many disadvantages and some advantages in
being a waiter. My mother can live comfortably; I am
able, even, to see that she gets some of the luxuries. Tom,
it’s this way&mdash;I can always get you a job as a waiter;
I’ll teach you the art. If you care to begin the end of
the week&mdash;all right. And remember this, as long as I
keep my job&mdash;this offer holds good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: I&mdash;I&mdash;(<em>Breaks off</em>) Thank you. (<em>A pause; then
smiling wryly</em>) I guess it’s safe enough to say, you’ll see
me at the end of the week. John you’re&mdash;(<em>Breaking off
again. A silence interrupted presently by the sound of
much vigorous rapping on the outer door of the flat. Rachel
appears and crosses over to the vestibule</em>). Hear the
racket! My kiddies gently begging for admittance. It’s
about twenty minutes of nine, isn’t it? (<em>Tom nods</em>). I
thought so. (<em>Goes into the entryway; presently reappears
with a group of six little girls ranging in age from
five to about nine. All are fighting to be close to her; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>

tot is self-possessed and self-sufficient. She carries
a red geranium in her hand and gives it her full attention</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Mary</span>: It’s my turn to get “Morning kiss” first, this
morning, Miss Rachel. You kissed Louise first yesterday.
You said you’d kiss us “alphebettically.” (<em>Ending
in a shriek</em>). You promised! (<em>Rachel kisses Mary, who
subsides</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Nancy</span> (<em>Imperiously</em>): Now, me. (<em>Rachel kisses
her, and then amid shrieks, recriminations, pulling of hair,
jostling, etc., she kisses the rest. The small tot is still
oblivious to everything that is going on</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Laughing</em>): You children will pull me limb from
limb; and then I’ll be all dead; and you’ll be sorry&mdash;see,
if you aren’t. (<em>They fall back immediately. Tom and
John watch in amused silence. Rachel loses all self-consciousness,
and seems to bloom in the children’s midst</em>).
Edith! come here this minute, and let me tie your hair-ribbon
again. Nancy, I’m ashamed of you, I saw you
trying to pull it off. (<em>Nancy looks abashed but mischievous</em>).
Louise, you look as sweet as sweet, this morning;
and Jenny, where did you get the pretty, pretty
dress?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Jenny</span> (<em>Snuffling, but proud</em>): My mother made it.
(<em>Pauses with more snuffles</em>). My mother says I have a
very bad cold. (<em><ins class="corr" id="tn47" title="Transcriber’s Note—“There is a brief silence interruped” changed to “There is a brief silence interrupted”.">There is a brief silence interrupted</ins>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span> (<em>In a sweet, little voice</em>): I&mdash;have&mdash;a&mdash;pitty&mdash;’ittle
flower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Honey, it’s beautiful. Don’t you want “Morning
kiss” too?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span>: Yes, I do.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Come, honey. (<em>Rachel kisses her</em>). Are you
going to give the pretty flower to Jenny’s teacher?
(<em>Vigorous shakings of the head in denial</em>). Is it for&mdash;mother?
(<em>More shakings of the head</em>). Is it for&mdash;let’s
see&mdash;Daddy? (<em>More shakings of the head</em>). I give up.
To whom are you going to give the pretty flower, honey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span> (<em>Shyly</em>): “Oo.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: You, darling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span>: Muzzer and I picked it&mdash;for “oo.” Here
’tis. (<em>Puts her finger in her mouth, and gives it shyly</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, I’m going to pay you with three big kisses.
One! Two! Three!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span>: I can count, One! Two! Free! Tan’t I?
I am going to school soon; and I wants to put the flower
in your hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Kneels</em>): All right, baby. (<em>Little Martha fumbles
and Rachel helps her</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span> (<em>Dreamily</em>): Miss Rachel, the ’ittle flower
loves you. It told me so. It said it wanted to lie in your
hair. It is going to tell you a pitty ’ittle secret. You
listen awful hard&mdash;and you’ll hear. I wish I were a
fairy and had a little wand, I’d turn everything into
flowers. Wouldn’t that be nice, Miss Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Lovely, honey!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Jenny</span> (<em>Snuffling loudly</em>): If I were a fairy and had
a wand, I’d turn you, Miss Rachel, into a queen&mdash;and
then I’d always be near you and see that you were happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Honey, how beautiful!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Louise</span>: I’d make my mother happy&mdash;if I were a
fairy. She cries all the time. My father can’t get anything
to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Nancy</span>: If I were a fairy, I’d turn a boy in my
school into a spider. I hate him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Honey, why?</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Little Nancy</span>: I’ll tell you sometime&mdash;I hate him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Edith</span>: Where’s Jimmy, Miss Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: He went long ago; and chickies, you’ll have to
clear out, all of you, now, or you’ll be late. Shoo! Shoo!
(<em>She drives them out prettily before her. They laugh
merrily. They all go into the vestibule</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Slowly</em>): Does it ever strike you&mdash;how pathetic and
tragic a thing&mdash;a little colored child is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Today, we colored men and women, everywhere&mdash;are
up against it. Every year, we are having a harder
time of it. In the South, they make it as impossible as
they can for us to get an education. We’re hemmed in
on all sides. Our one safeguard&mdash;the ballot&mdash;in most
states, is taken away already, or is being taken away.
Economically, in a few lines, we have a slight show&mdash;but
at what a cost! In the North, they make a pretence
of liberality: they give us the ballot and a good education,
and then&mdash;snuff us out. Each year, the problem just to
live, gets more difficult to solve. How about these children&mdash;if
we’re fools enough to have any? (<span class="smcap">Rachel</span> <em>reenters.
Her face is drawn and pale. She returns to the
kitchenette.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Slowly, with emphasis</em>): That part&mdash;is damnable!
(<em>A silence.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Suddenly looking at the clock</em>): It’s later than I
thought. I’ll have to be pulling out of here now, if you
don’t mind. (<em>Raising his voice</em>) Rachel! (<em>Rachel still
drawn and pale, appears in the doorway of the kitchenette.
She is without her apron</em>). I’ve got to go now,
Sis. I leave John in your hands.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I’ve got to go, myself, in a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: Nonsense, man! Sit still. I’ll begin to think, in a
minute, you’re afraid of the ladies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: What! And not ashamed to acknowledge it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: You’re lots wiser than I dreamed. So long! (<em>Gets
hat out in the entry-way and returns; smiles wryly.</em>)
“Morituri Salutamus”. (<em>They nod at him&mdash;Rachel wistfully.
He goes out. There is the sound of an opening
and closing door. Rachel sits down. A rather uncomfortable
silence, on the part of Rachel, ensues. Strong
is imperturbable.</em>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Nervously</em>): John!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I&mdash;I listened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Listened! To what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: To you and Tom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Well,&mdash;what of it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I didn’t think it was quite fair not to tell you. It&mdash;it
seemed, well, like eavesdropping.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Don’t worry about it. Nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I’m glad&mdash;I want to thank you for what you did
for Tom. He needs you, and will need you. You’ll
help him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: (<em>Thoughtfully</em>): Rachel, each one&mdash;has his own
little battles. I’ll do what I can. After all, an outsider
doesn’t help much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: But friendship&mdash;just friendship&mdash;helps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Yes. (<em>A silence</em>). Rachel, do you hear anything
encouraging from the schools? Any hope for you yet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, nor ever will be. I know that now. There’s
no more chance for me than there is for Tom,&mdash;or than
there was for you&mdash;or for any of us with dark skins. It’s
lucky for me that I love to keep house, and cook, and
sew. I’ll never get anything else. Ma dear’s sewing,
the little work Tom has been able to get, and the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
sewing I sometimes get to do&mdash;keep us from the poorhouse.
We live. According to your philosophy, I suppose,
make the best of it&mdash;it might be worse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Quietly</em>): You don’t want to get morbid over
these things, you know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Scornfully</em>): That’s it. If you see things as they
are, you’re either pessimistic or morbid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: In the long run, do you believe, that attitude of
mind&mdash;will be&mdash;beneficial to you? I’m ten years older
than you. I tried your way. I know. Mine is the only
sane one. (<em>Goes over to her slowly; deliberately puts
his hands on her hair, and tips her head back. He looks
down into her face quietly without saying anything</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Nervous and startled</em>): Why, John, don’t! (<em>He
pays no attention, but continue to look down into her
face</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Half to himself</em>): Perhaps&mdash;if you had&mdash;a little
more fun in your life, your point of view would be&mdash;more
normal. I’ll arrange it so I can take you to some
theatre, one night, this week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Irritably</em>): You talk as though I were a&mdash;a jellyfish.
You’ll take me, how do you know <em>I’ll</em> go?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: You will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Sarcastically</em>): Indeed! (<span class="smcap">Strong</span> <em>makes no
reply</em>). I wonder if you know how&mdash;how&mdash;maddening
you are. Why, you talk as though my will counts for
nothing. It’s as if you’re trying to master me. I think
a domineering man is detestable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Softly</em>): If he’s, perhaps, <em>the</em> man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Hurriedly, as though she had not heard</em>): Besides,
some of these theatres put you off by yourself as though
you had leprosy. I’m not going.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Smiling at her</em>): You know I wouldn’t ask you
to go, under those circumstances. (<em>A silence</em>). Well, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
must be going now. (<em>He takes her hand, and looks at
it reverently. Rachel, at first resists; but he refuses to
let go. When she finds it useless, she ceases to resist.
He turns his head and smiles down into her face</em>).
Rachel, I am coming back to see you, this evening.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I’m sure <em>we’ll</em> all be very glad to see you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Looking at her calmly</em>): I said&mdash;<em>you</em>. (<em>Very deliberately,
he turns her hand palm upwards, leans over and
kisses it; then he puts it back into her lap. He touches her
cheek lightly</em>). Good-bye&mdash;little Rachel. (<em>Turns in the
vestibule door and looks back, smiling</em>). Until tonight.
(<em>He goes out. Rachel sits for some time without moving.
She is lost in a beautiful day-dream. Presently
she sighs happily, and after looking furtively around the
room, lifts the palm John has kissed to her lips. She
laughs shyly and jumping up, begins to hum. She opens
the window at the rear of the room and then commences
to thread the sewing-machine. She hums happily the
whole time. A light rapping is heard at the outer door.
Rachel listens. It stops, and begins again. There is
something insistent, and yet hopeless in the sound.
Rachel looking puzzled, goes out into the vestibule.... The
door closes. Rachel, a black woman, poorly dressed,
and a little ugly, black child come in. There is the stoniness
of despair in the woman’s face. The child is thin,
nervous, suspicious, frightened</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>In a sharp, but toneless voice</em>): May I sit
down? I’m tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Puzzled, but gracious; draws up a chair for her</em>):
Why, certainly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: No, you don’t know me&mdash;never even heard of
me&mdash;nor I of you. I was looking at the vacant flat on
this floor&mdash;and saw your name&mdash;on your door,&mdash;“Loving!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
It’s a strange name to come across&mdash;in this world.&mdash;I
thought, perhaps, you might give me some information.
(<em>The child hides behind her mother and looks
around at Rachel in a frightened way</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Smiling at the woman and child in a kindly
manner</em>): I’ll be glad to tell you anything, I am able
Mrs.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Lane. What I want to know is, how do they
treat the colored children in the school I noticed around
the corner? (<em>The child clutches at her mother’s dress</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Perplexed</em>): Very well&mdash;I’m sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>Bluntly</em>): What reason have you for being
sure?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Why, the little boy I’ve adopted goes there; and
he’s very happy. All the children in this apartment-house
go there too; and I know they’re happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Do you know how many colored children there
are in the school?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Why, I should guess around thirty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: I see. (<em>Pauses</em>). What color is this little
adopted boy of yours?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Gently</em>): Why&mdash;he’s brown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Any black children there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Nervously</em>): Why&mdash;yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Do you mind if I send Ethel over by the piano
to sit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: N&mdash;no, certainly not. (<em>Places a chair by the
piano and goes to the little girl holding out her hand.
She smiles beautifully. The child gets farther behind her
mother</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: She won’t go to you&mdash;she’s afraid of everybody
now but her father and me. Come Ethel. (<em>Mrs. Lane
takes the little girl by the hand and leads her to the chair.
In a gentler voice</em>) Sit down, Ethel. (<em>Ethel obeys.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
When her mother starts back again toward Rachel, she
holds out her hands pitifully. She makes no sound</em>).
I’m not going to leave you, Ethel. I’ll be right over here.
You can see me. (<em>The look of agony on the child’s face,
as her mother leaves her, makes Rachel shudder</em>). Do
you mind if we sit over here by the sewing-machine?
Thank you. (<em>They move their chairs</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Looking at the little, pitiful figure watching its
mother almost unblinkingly</em>): Does Ethel like apples, Mrs.
Lane?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Do you mind if I give her one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: No. Thank you, very much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Goes into the kitchenette and returns with a
fringed napkin, a plate, and a big, red apple, cut into
quarters. She goes to the little girl, who cowers away
from her; very gently</em>). Here, dear, little girl, is a
beautiful apple for you. (<em>The gentle tones have no appeal
for the trembling child before her</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>Coming forward</em>): I’m sorry, but I’m afraid
she won’t take it from you. Ethel, the kind lady has given
you an apple. Thank her nicely. Here! I’ll spread the
napkin for you, and put the plate in your lap. Thank the
lady like a good little girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel</span> (<em>Very low</em>): Thank you. (<em>They return to their
seats. Ethel with difficulty holds the plate in her lap.
During the rest of the interview between Rachel and her
mother, she divides her attention between the apple on
the plate and her mother’s face. She makes no attempt
to eat the apple, but holds the plate in her lap with a care
that is painful to watch. Often, too, she looks over her
shoulder fearfully. The conversation between Rachel
and her mother is carried on in low tones</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: I’ve got to move&mdash;it’s <em>Ethel</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: What is the matter with that child? It’s&mdash;it’s
heartbreaking to see her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: I understand how you feel,&mdash;I don’t feel anything,
myself, any more. (<em>A pause</em>). My husband and I
are poor, and we’re ugly and we’re black. Ethel looks like
her father more than she does like me. We live in 55th
Street&mdash;near the railroad. It’s a poor neighborhood, but
the rent’s cheap. My husband is a porter in a store; and,
to help out, I’m a caretaker. (<em>Pauses</em>). I don’t know
why I’m telling you all this. We had a nice little home&mdash;and
the three of us were happy. Now we’ve got to move.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Move! Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: It’s Ethel. I put her in school this September.
She stayed two weeks. (<em>Pointing to Ethel</em>) That’s the
result.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>In horror</em>): You mean&mdash;that just two weeks&mdash;in
school&mdash;did that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Yes. Ethel never had a sick day in her life&mdash;before.
(<em>A brief pause</em>). I took her to the doctor at
the end of the two weeks. He says she’s a nervous wreck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: But what could they have done to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>Laughs grimly and mirthlessly</em>): I’ll tell you
what they did the first day. Ethel is naturally sensitive
and backward. She’s not assertive. The teacher saw
that, and, after I had left, told her to sit in a seat in the
rear of the class. She was alone there&mdash;in a corner.
The children, immediately feeling there was something
wrong with Ethel because of the teacher’s attitude, turned
and stared at her. When the teacher’s back was turned
they whispered about her, pointed their fingers at her
and tittered. The teacher divided the class into two parts,
divisions, I believe, they are called. She forgot all about
Ethel, of course, until the last minute, and then, looking
back, said sharply: “That little girl there may join this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
division,” meaning the group of pupils standing around
her. Ethel naturally moved slowly. The teacher called
her sulky and told her to lose a part of her recess. When
Ethel came up&mdash;the children drew away from her in every
direction. She was left standing alone. The teacher then
proceeded to give a lesson about kindness to animals.
Funny, isn’t it, <em>kindness</em> to <em>animals</em>? The children forgot
Ethel in the excitement of talking about their pets.
Presently, the teacher turned to Ethel and said disagreeably:
“Have you a pet?” Ethel said, “Yes,” very low.
“Come, speak up, you sulky child, what is it?” Ethel
said: “A blind puppy.” They all laughed, the teacher
and all. Strange, isn’t it, but Ethel loves that puppy.
She spoke up: “It’s mean to laugh at a little blind puppy.
I’m glad he’s blind.” This remark brought forth more
laughter. “Why are you glad,” the teacher asked
curiously. Ethel refused to say. (<em>Pauses</em>). When I
asked her why, do you know what she told me? “If he
saw me, he might not love me any more.” (<em>A pause</em>).
Did I tell you that Ethel is only seven years old?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Drawing her breath sharply</em>): Oh! I didn’t believe
any one could be as cruel as that&mdash;to a little child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: It isn’t very pleasant, is it? When the teacher
found out that Ethel wouldn’t answer, she said severely:
“Take your seat!” At recess, all the children went out.
Ethel could hear them playing and laughing and shrieking.
Even the teacher went too. She was made to sit there
all alone&mdash;in that big room&mdash;because God made her ugly&mdash;and
black. (<em>Pauses</em>). When the recess was half over
the teacher came back. “You may go now,” she said
coldly. Ethel didn’t stir. “Did you hear me?” “Yes’m.”
“Why don’t you obey?” “I don’t want to go out, please.”
“You don’t, don’t you, you stubborn child! Go immediately!”
Ethel went. She stood by the school steps.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
No one spoke to her. The children near her moved away
in every direction. They stopped playing, many of them,
and watched her. They stared as only children can stare.
Some began whispering about her. Presently one child
came up and ran her hand roughly over Ethel’s face. She
looked at her hand and Ethel’s face and ran screaming
back to the others, “It won’t come off! See!” Other
children followed the first child’s example. Then one
boy spoke up loudly: “I know what she is, she’s a nigger!”
Many took up the cry. God or the devil interfered&mdash;the
bell rang. The children filed in. One boy
boldly called her “Nigger!” before the teacher. She said,
“That isn’t nice,”&mdash;but she smiled at the boy. Things
went on about the same for the rest of the day. At the
end of school, Ethel put on her hat and coat&mdash;the teacher
made her hang them at a distance from the other pupils’
wraps; and started for home. Quite a crowd escorted
her. They called her “Nigger!” all the way. I <em>made</em>
Ethel go the next day. I complained to the authorities.
They treated me lightly. I was determined not to let
them force my child out of school. At the end of two
weeks&mdash;I had to take her out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Brokenly</em>): Why,&mdash;I never&mdash;in all my life&mdash;heard
anything&mdash;so&mdash;pitiful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Did you ever go to school here?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes. I was made to feel my color&mdash;but I never
had an experience like that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: How many years ago were you in the graded
schools?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh!&mdash;around ten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>Laughs grimly</em>): Ten years! Every year
things are getting worse. Last year wasn’t as bad as this.
(<em>Pauses.</em>) So they treat the children all right in this
school?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes! Yes! I know that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: I can’t afford to take this flat here, but I’ll
take it. I’m going to have Ethel educated. Although,
when you think of it,&mdash;it’s all rather useless&mdash;this education!
What are our children going to do with it, when
they get it? We strive and save and sacrifice to educate
them&mdash;and the whole time&mdash;down underneath, we know&mdash;they’ll
have no chance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Sadly</em>): Yes, that’s true, all right.&mdash;God seems
to have forgotten us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: God! It’s all a lie about God. I know.&mdash;This
fall I sent Ethel to a white Sunday-school near us. She
received the same treatment there she did in the day
school. Her being there, nearly broke up the school.
At the end, the superintendent called her to him and asked
her if she didn’t know of some nice colored Sunday-school.
He told her she must feel out of place, and
uncomfortable there. That’s your Church of God!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh! how unspeakably brutal. (<em>Controls herself
with an effort; after a pause</em>) Have you any other
children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>Dryly</em>): Hardly! If I had another&mdash;I’d kill
it. It’s kinder. (<em>Rising presently</em>) Well, I must go,
now. Thank you, for your information&mdash;and for
listening. (<em>Suddenly</em>) You aren’t married, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span>: Don’t marry&mdash;that’s my advice. Come, Ethel.
(<em>Ethel gets up and puts down the things in her lap,
carefully upon her chair. She goes in a hurried, timid
way to her mother and clutches her hand</em>). Say good-bye
to the lady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel</span> (<em>Faintly</em>): Good-bye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> <em>(Kneeling by the little girl&mdash;a beautiful smile on
her face</em>) Dear little girl, won’t you let me kiss you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
good-bye? I love little girls. (<em>The child hides behind
her mother; continuing brokenly</em>) Oh!&mdash;no child&mdash;ever
did&mdash;that to me&mdash;before!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Lane</span> (<em>In a gentler voice</em>): Perhaps, when we move in
here, the first of the month, things may be better. Thank
you, again. Good-morning! You don’t belie your name.
(<em>All three go into the vestibule. The outside door opens
and closes. Rachel as though dazed and stricken returns.
She sits in a chair, leans forward, and clasping her hands
loosely between her knees, stares at the chair with the
apple on it where Ethel Lane has sat. She does not move
for some time. Then she gets up and goes to the window
in the rear center and sits there. She breathes in the air
deeply and then goes to the sewing-machine and begins
to sew on something she is making. Presently her feet
slow down on the pedals; she stops; and begins brooding
again. After a short pause, she gets up and begins to
pace up and down slowly, mechanically, her head bent
forward. The sharp ringing of the electric bell breaks
in upon this. Rachel starts and goes slowly into the
vestibule. She is heard speaking dully through the tube</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes!&mdash;All right! Bring it up! (<em>Presently she
returns with a long flower box. She opens it listlessly
at the table. Within are six, beautiful crimson rosebuds
with long stems. Rachel looks at the name on the card.
She sinks down slowly on her knee and leans her head
against the table. She sighs wearily</em>) Oh! John!
John!&mdash;What are we to do?&mdash;I’m&mdash;I’m&mdash;afraid! Everywhere&mdash;it
is the same thing. My mother! My little
brother! Little, black, crushed Ethel! (<em>In a whisper</em>)
Oh! God! You who I have been taught to believe are so
good, so beautiful how could&mdash;You permit&mdash;these&mdash;things?
(<em>Pauses, raises her head and sees the rosebuds.
Her face softens and grows beautiful, very sweetly</em>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
Dear little rosebuds&mdash;you&mdash;make me think&mdash;of sleeping,
curled up, happy babies. Dear beautiful, little rosebuds!
(<em>Pauses; goes on thoughtfully to the rosebuds</em>) When&mdash;I
look&mdash;at you&mdash;I believe&mdash;God is beautiful. He who can
make a little exquisite thing like this, and this can’t be
cruel. Oh! He can’t mean me&mdash;to give up&mdash;love&mdash;and
the hope of little children. (<em>There is the sound of a
small hand knocking at the outer door. Rachel smiles</em>).
My Jimmy! It must be twelve o’clock. (<em>Rises</em>). I
didn’t dream it was so late. (<em>Starts for the vestibule</em>).
Oh! the world can’t be so bad. I don’t believe it. I
won’t. I <em>must</em> forget that little girl. My little Jimmy is
happy&mdash;and today John&mdash;sent me beautiful rosebuds. Oh,
there are lovely things, yet. (<em>Goes into the vestibule. A
child’s eager cry is heard; and Rachel carrying Jimmy in
her arms comes in. He has both arms about her neck
and is hugging her. With him in her arms, she sits down
in the armchair at the right front</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, honey, how was school today?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Sobering a trifle</em>): All right, Ma Rachel. (<em>Suddenly
sees the roses</em>) Oh! look at the pretty flowers. Why,
Ma Rachel, you forgot to put them in water. They’ll die.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, so they will. Hop down this minute, and
I’ll put them in right away. (<em>Gathers up box and flowers
and goes into the kitchenette. Jimmy climbs back into
the chair. He looks thoughtful and serious. Rachel
comes back with the buds in a tall, glass vase. She puts
the fern on top of the piano, and places the vase in the
centre of the table</em>). There, honey, that’s better, isn’t it?
Aren’t they lovely?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Yes, that’s lots better. Now they won’t die, will
they? Rosebuds are just like little “chilyun,” aren’t they,
Ma Rachel? If you are good to them, they’ll grow up
into lovely roses, won’t they? And if you hurt them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
they’ll die. Ma Rachel do you think all peoples are kind
to little rosebuds?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Watching Jimmy shortly</em>): Why, of course. Who
could hurt little children? Who would have the heart to
do such a thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: If you hurt them, it would be lots kinder, wouldn’t
it, to kill them all at once, and not a little bit and a little
bit?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Sharply</em>): Why, honey boy, why are you talking
like this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Ma Rachel, what is a “Nigger”?</p>
</div>

<p class="center">(<em>Rachel recoils as though she had been struck</em>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Honey boy, why&mdash;why do you ask that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Some big boys called me that when I came out of
school just now. They said: “Look at the little nigger!”
And they laughed. One of them runned, no ranned,
after me and threw stones; and they all kept calling
“Nigger! Nigger! Nigger!” One stone struck me hard
in the back, and it hurt awful bad; but I didn’t cry, Ma
Rachel. I wouldn’t let them make me cry. The stone
hurts me there, Ma Rachel; but what they called me hurts
and hurts here. What is a “Nigger,” Ma Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Controlling herself with a tremendous effort. At
last she sweeps down upon him and hugs and kisses him</em>):
Why, honey boy, those boys didn’t mean anything. Silly,
little, honey boy! They’re rough, that’s all. How <em>could</em>
they mean anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: You’re only saying that, Ma Rachel, so I won’t be
hurt. I know. It wouldn’t ache here like it does&mdash;if
they didn’t mean something.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Abruptly</em>): Where’s Mary, honey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: She’s in her flat. She came in just after I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, honey, I’m going to give you two big cookies
and two to take to Mary; and you may stay in there and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
play with her, till I get your lunch ready. Won’t that be
jolly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Brightening a little</em>): Why, you never give me but
one at a time. You’ll give me two?&mdash;One? Two? (<em>Rachel
gets the cookies and brings them to him. Jimmy climbs
down from the chair</em>). Shoo! now, little honey boy. See
how many laughs you can make for me, before I come
after you. Hear? Have a good time, now. (<em>Jimmy
starts for the door quickly; but he begins to slow down.
His face gets long and serious again. Rachel watches
him</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Jumping at him</em>): Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here
quickly, little chicken. (<em>She follows him out. The outer
door opens and shuts. Presently she returns. She looks
old and worn and grey; calmly. Pauses</em>). First, it’s little,
black Ethel&mdash;and then’s it’s Jimmy. Tomorrow, it
will be some other little child. The blight&mdash;sooner or
later&mdash;strikes all. My little Jimmy, only seven years old
poisoned! (<em>Through the open window comes the laughter
of little children at play. Rachel, shuddering, covers
her ears</em>). And once I said, centuries ago, it must have
been: “How can life be so terrible, when there are little
children in the world?” Terrible! Terrible! (<em>In a whisper,
slowly</em>) That’s the reason it is so terrible. (<em>The
laughter reaches her again; this time she listens</em>). And,
suddenly, some day, from out of the black, the blight
shall descend, and shall still forever&mdash;the laughter on
those little lips, and in those little hearts. (<em>Pauses
thoughtfully</em>). And the loveliest thing&mdash;almost, that ever
happened to me, that beautiful voice, in my dream, those
beautiful words: “Rachel, you are to be the mother to
little children.” (<em>Pauses, then slowly and with dawning
surprise</em>). Why, God, you were making a mock of me;
you were laughing at me. <ins class="corr" id="tn62" title="Transcriber’s Note—“I didn’t belive” changed to “I didn’t believe”."> I didn’t believe</ins>
God could laugh<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
at our sufferings, but He can. We are accursed, accursed!
We have nothing, absolutely nothing. (<em>Strong’s
rosebuds attract her attention. She goes over to them,
puts her hand out as if to touch them, and then shakes
her head, very sweetly</em>) No, little rosebuds, I may not
touch you. Dear, little, baby rosebuds,&mdash;I am accursed.
(<em>Gradually her whole form stiffens, she breathes deeply;
at last slowly</em>). You God!&mdash;You terrible, laughing God!
Listen! I swear&mdash;and may my soul be damned to all
eternity, if I do break this oath&mdash;I swear&mdash;that no child
of mine shall ever lie upon my breast, for I will not have
it rise up, in the terrible days that are to be&mdash;and call me
cursed. (<em>A pause, very wistfully; questioningly</em>).
Never to know the loveliest thing in all the world&mdash;the
feel of a little head, the touch of little hands, the beautiful
utter dependence&mdash;of a little child? (<em>With sudden
frenzy</em>) You can laugh, Oh God! Well, so can I. (<em>Bursts
into terrible, racking laughter</em>) But I can be kinder than
You. (<em>Fiercely she snatches the rosebuds from the vase,
grasps them roughly, tears each head from the stem, and
grinds it under her feet. The vase goes over with a
crash; the water drips unheeded over the table-cloth and
floor</em>). If I kill, You Mighty God, I kill at once&mdash;I do
not torture. (<em>Falls face downward on the floor. The
laughter of the children shrills loudly through the window</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time</span>: <em>Seven o’clock in the evening, one week later</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Place</span>: <em>The same room. There is a coal fire in the grate.

dark green porcelain shade is in the center of the table.
Mrs. Loving and Tom are sitting by the table, Mrs.
Loving sewing, Tom reading. There is the sound of
much laughter and the shrill screaming of a child from
the bedrooms. Presently Jimmy clad in a flannelet
sleeping suit, covering all of him but his head and hands,
chases a pillow, which has come flying through the
doorway at the rear. He struggles with it, finally gets
it in his arms, and rushes as fast as he can through the
doorway again. Rachel jumps at him with a cry. He
drops the pillow and shrieks. There is a tussle for possession
of it, and they disappear. The noise grows

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Hesitatingly climbs into her lap, but presently snuggles

to feel of it; and it smells like&mdash;like&mdash;oh!&mdash;like a barn.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: My! how complimentary! I like that. Like a
barn, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: What’s “complimentry”?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Stoutly</em>): Well, that is “complimentary.” It smells

last summer. ’Member?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes honey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>After a brief pause</em>): Ma Rachel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Tell me a story, please. It’s “story-time,” now,
isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, let’s see. (<em>They both look into the fire for
a space; beginning softly</em>) Once upon a time, there were
two, dear, little boys, and they were all alone in the world.
They lived with a cruel, old man and woman, who made
them work hard, very hard&mdash;all day, and beat them when
they did not move fast enough, and always, every night,
before they went to bed. They slept in an attic on a
rickety, narrow bed, that went screech! screech! whenever
they moved. And, in summer, they nearly died with
the heat up there, and in winter, with the cold. One wintry
night, when they were both weeping very bitterly after
a particularly hard beating, they suddenly heard a
pleasant voice saying: “Why are you crying, little boys?”
They looked up, and there, in the moonlight, by their bed,
was the dearest, little old lady. She was dressed all in
gray, from the peak of her little pointed hat to her little,
buckled shoes. She held a black cane much taller than
her little self. Her hair fell about her ears in tiny, grey
corkscrew curls, and they bobbed about as she moved.
Her eyes were black and bright&mdash;as bright as&mdash;well, as
that lovely, white light there. No, there! And her
cheeks were as red as the apple I gave you yesterday. Do
you remember?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Dreamily</em>): Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: “Why are you crying, little boys?” she asked again,
in a lovely, low, little voice. “Because we are tired and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
sore and hungry and cold; and we are all alone in the
world; and we don’t know how to laugh any more. We
should so like to laugh again.” “Why, that’s easy,”
she said, “it’s just like this.” And she laughed a little,
joyous, musical laugh. “Try!” she commanded. They
tried, but their laughing boxes were very rusty, and they
made horrid sounds. “Well,” she said, “I advise you to
pack up, and go away, as soon as you can, to the Land
of Laughter. You’ll soon learn there, I can tell you.”
“Is there such a land?” they asked doubtfully. “To be
sure there is,” she answered the least bit sharply. “We
never heard of it,” they said. “Well, I’m sure there must
be plenty of things you never heard about,” she said just
the “leastest” bit more sharply. “In a moment you’ll be
telling me flowers don’t talk together, and the birds.”
“We never heard of such a thing,” they said in surprise,
their eyes like saucers. “There!” she said, bobbing her
little curls. “What did I tell you? You have much to
learn.” “How do you get to the Land of Laughter?”
they asked. “You go out of the eastern gate of the town,
just as the sun is rising; and you take the highway there,
and follow it; and if you go with it long enough, it will
bring you to the very gates of the Land of Laughter. It’s
a long, long way from here; and it will take you many
days.” The words had scarcely left her mouth, when, lo!
the little lady disappeared, and where she had stood was
the white square of moonlight&mdash;nothing else. And without
more ado these two little boys put their arms around
each other and fell fast asleep. And in the grey, just
before daybreak, they awoke and dressed; and, putting on
their ragged caps and mittens, for it was a wintry day,
they stole out of the house and made for the eastern gate.
And just as they reached it, and passed through, the
whole east leapt into fire. All day they walked, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
days thereafter, and kindly people, by the way, took them
in and gave them food and drink and sometimes a bed at
night. Often they slept by the roadside, but they didn’t
mind that for the climate was delightful&mdash;not too hot, and
not too cold. They soon threw away their ragged little
mittens. They walked for many days, and there was no
Land of Laughter. Once they met an old man, richly
dressed, with shining jewels on his fingers, and he stopped
them and asked: “Where are you going so fast, little
boys?” “We are going to the Land of Laughter,” they
said together gravely. “That,” said the old man, “is a
very foolish thing to do. Come with me, and I will take
you to the Land of Riches. I will cover you with garments
of beauty, and give you jewels and a castle to live
in and servants and horses and many things besides.”
And they said to him: “No, we wish to learn how to
laugh again; we have forgotten how, and we are going
to the Land of Laughter.” “You will regret not going
with me. See, if you don’t,” he said; and he left them
in quite a huff. And they walked again, many days, and
again they met an old man. He was tall and imposing-looking
and very dignified. And he said: “Where are
you going so fast, little boys?” “We are going to the
Land of Laughter,” they said together very seriously.
“What!” he said, “that is an extremely foolish thing to
do. Come with me, and I will give you power. I will
make you great men: generals, kings, emperors, Whatever
you desire to accomplish will be permitted you.”
And they smiled politely: “Thank you very much, but
we have forgotten how to laugh, and we are going there
to learn how.” He looked upon them haughtily, without
speaking, and disappeared. And they walked and walked
more days; and they met another old man. And he was
clad in rags, and his face was thin, and his eyes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
unhappy. And he whispered to them: “Where are you
going so fast, little boys?” “We are going to the Land
of Laughter,” they answered, without a smile. “Laughter!
Laughter! that is useless. Come with me and I will
show you the beauty of life through sacrifice, suffering
for others. That is the only life. I come from the Land
of Sacrifice.” And they thanked him kindly, but said:
“We have suffered long enough. We have forgotten how
to laugh. We would learn again.” And they went on;
and he looked after them very wistfully. They walked
more days, and at last they came to the Land of Laughter.
And how do you suppose they knew this? Because they
could hear, over the wall, the sound of joyous laughter,&mdash;the
laughter of men, women, and children. And one sat
guarding the gate, and they went to her. “We have come
a long, long distance; and we would enter the Land of
Laughter.” “Let me see you smile, first,” she said gently.
“I sit at the gate; and no one who does not know how to
smile may enter the Land of Laughter.” And they tried
to smile, but could not. “Go away and practice,” she said
kindly, “and come back tomorrow.” And they went
away, and practiced all night how to smile; and in the
morning they returned, and the gentle lady at the gate
said: “Dear little boys, have you learned how to smile?”
And they said: “We have tried. How is this?” “Better,”
she said, “much better. Practice some more, and
come back tomorrow.” And they went away obediently
and practiced, And they came the third day. And she
said: “Now try again.” And tears of delight came into
her lovely eyes. “Those were very beautiful smiles,” she
said. “Now, you may enter.” And she unlocked the gate,
and kissed them both, and they entered the Land&mdash;the
beautiful Land of Laughter. Never had they seen such
blue skies, such green trees and grass; never had they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
heard such birds songs. And people, men, women and
children, laughing softly, came to meet them, and took
them in, and made them as home; and soon, very soon,
they learned to sleep. And they grew up here, and married,
and had laughing, happy children. And sometimes
they thought of the Land of Riches, and said: “Ah! well!”
and sometimes of the Land of Power, and sighed a little;
and sometimes of the Land of Sacrifice&mdash;and their eyes
were wistful. But they soon forgot, and laughed again.
And they grew old, laughing. And then when they died&mdash;a
laugh was on their lips. Thus are things in the beautiful
Land of Laughter. (<em>There is a long pause</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: I like that story, Ma Rachel. It’s nice to laugh,
isn’t is? Is there such a land?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Softly</em>): What do you think, honey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: I thinks it would be awful nice if there was. Don’t
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Wistfully</em>): If there only were! If there only
were!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Ma Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: It makes you think&mdash;kind of&mdash;doesn’t it&mdash;of sunshine
medicine?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes, honey,&mdash;but it isn’t medicine there. It’s always
there&mdash;just like&mdash;well&mdash;like our air here. It’s <em>always</em>
sunshine there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Always sunshine? Never any dark?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, honey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: You’d&mdash;never&mdash;be&mdash;afraid there, then, would you?
Never afraid of nothing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, honey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>With a big sigh</em>): Oh!&mdash;Oh! I <em>wisht</em> it was here&mdash;not
there. (<em>Puts his hand up to Rachel’s face; suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>

crying. Your face is all wet. Why! Don’t cry! Don’t
cry!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Gently</em>): Do you remember that I told you the lady
at the gate had tears of joy in her eyes, when the two,
dear, little boys smiled that beautiful smile?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, these are tears of joy, honey, that’s all&mdash;tears
of joy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: It must be awful queer to have tears of joy, ’cause
you’re happy. I never did. (<em>With a sigh</em>). But, if you
say they are, dear Ma Rachel, they must be. You knows
everything, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Sadly</em>): Some things, honey, some things. (<em>A
silence</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Sighing happily</em>): This is the beautiful-est night I
ever knew. If you would do just one more thing, it
would be lots more beautiful. Will you, Ma Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, what, honey?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Will you sing&mdash;at the piano, I mean, it’s lots prettier
that way&mdash;the little song you used to rock me to sleep
by? You know, the one about the “Slumber Boat”?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Oh! honey, not tonight. You’re too tired. It’s
bedtime now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span> (<em>Patting her face with his little hand; wheedlingly</em>):
Please! Ma Rachel, please! pretty please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, honey boy, this once, then. Tonight, you
shall have the little song&mdash;I used to sing you to sleep by
(<em>half to herself</em>) perhaps, for the last time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jimmy</span>: Why, Ma Rachel, why the last time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Shaking her head sadly, goes to the piano; in a

sings. Her voice is full of pent-up longing, and heartbreak,
and hopelessness. She ends in a little sob, but
attempts to cover it by singing, lightly and daintily, the
chorus of “The Owl and the Moon.” ... Then softly and
with infinite tenderness, almost against her will, she plays
and sings again the refrain of the “Slumber Boat”</em>):</p>

you know. Why?</p>

Jimmy boy, you can hardly keep those little peepers open,
can you? Come on, honey. (<em>Rachel and Jimmy go out
the rear doorway. There is a silence</em>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Slowly, as though thinking aloud</em>): I try to
make out what could have happened; but it’s no use&mdash;I
can’t. Those four days, she lay in bed hardly moving,
scarcely speaking. Only her eyes seemed alive. I never
saw such a wide, tragic look in my life. It was as though
her soul had been mortally wounded. But how? how?
What could have happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span> (<em>Quietly</em>): I don’t know. She generally tells me
everything; but she avoids me now. If we are alone in
a room&mdash;she gets out. I don’t know what it means.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: She will hardly let Jimmy out of her sight.
While he’s at school, she’s nervous and excited. She
seems always to be listening, but for what? When he
returns, she nearly devours him. And she always asks
him in a frightened sort of way, her face as pale and tense
as can be: “Well, honey boy, how was school today?”
And he always answers, “Fine, Ma Rachel, fine! I
learned&mdash;”; and then he goes on to tell her everything that
has happened. And when he has finished, she says in an
uneasy sort of way: “Is&mdash;is that all?” And when he
says “Yes,” she relaxes and becomes limp. After a little
while she becomes feverishly happy. She plays with
Jimmy and the children more than ever she did&mdash;and she
played a good deal, as you know. They’re here, or she’s
with them. Yesterday, I said in remonstrance, when she
came in, her face pale and haggard and black hollows under
her eyes: “Rachel, remember you’re just out of a sick-bed.
You’re not well enough to go on like this.” “I
know,” was all she would say, “but I’ve got to. I can’t
help myself. This part of their little lives must be happy&mdash;it
just must be.” (<em>Pauses</em>). The last couple of nights,
<ins class="corr" id="tn78" title="Transcriber’s Note—“Jimmy has awakened and cried most pitfully” changed to “Jimmy has awakened and cried most pitifully”.">Jimmy has awakened and cried most pitifully</ins>.
She wouldn’t let me go to him; said I had enough trouble, and
she could quiet him. She never will let me know why he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
cries; but she stays with him, and soothes him until, at
last, he falls asleep again. Every time she has come out
like a rag; and her face is like a dead woman’s. Strange
isn’t it, this is the first time we have ever been able to talk
it over? Tom, what could have happened?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tom</span>: I don’t know, Ma, but I feel, as you do; something
terrible and sudden has hurt her soul; and, poor little
thing, she’s trying bravely to readjust herself to life again.
(<em>Pauses, looks at his watch and then rises, and goes to
her. He pats her back awkwardly</em>). Well, Ma, I’m going
now. Don’t worry too much. Youth, you know,
gets over things finally. It takes them hard, that’s all&mdash;.
At least, that’s what the older heads tell us. (<em>Gets his hat
and stands in the vestibule doorway</em>). Ma, you know, I
begin with John tomorrow. (<em>With emotion</em>) I don’t believe
we’ll ever forget John. Good-night! (<em>Exit. Mrs.
Loving continues to sew. Rachel, her hair arranged, reenters
through the rear doorway. She is humming</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: He’s sleeping like a top. Aren’t little children,
Ma dear, the sweetest things, when they’re all helpless
and asleep? One little hand is under his cheek; and he’s
smiling. (<em>Stops suddenly, biting her lips. A pause</em>)
Where’s Tom?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: He went out a few minutes ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Sitting in Tom’s chair and picking up his paper.

rapidly; presently trying to make her tone casual</em>): Ma,&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;aren’t
going anywhere tonight, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: I’ve got to go out for a short time about half-past
eight. Mrs. Jordan, you know. I’ll not be gone
very long, though. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Why, I don’t see how I can. I’ve made the
engagement. It’s about a new reception gown; and she’s
exceedingly exacting, as you know. I can’t afford to lose
her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No, I suppose not. All right, Ma dear. (<em>Presently,
paper in hand, she laughs, but not quite naturally</em>).
Look! Ma dear! How is that for fashion, anyway? Isn’t
it the “limit”? (<em>Rises and shows her mother a picture

her mother’s hand</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span> (<em>Anxiously</em>): Rachel, your nerves are right on
edge; and your hand feels like fire. I’ll have to see a
doctor about you; and that’s all there is to it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Laughing nervously, and moving toward the vestibule</em>).
Nonsense, Ma dear! Just because I let out a
whoop now and then, and have nice warm hands? (<em>Goes
out, is heard talking through the tube</em>) Yes! (<em>Her voice
emitting tremendous relief</em>). Oh! bring it right up!
(<em>Appearing in the doorway</em>) Ma dear, did you buy anything
at Goddard’s today?</p>

so late in delivering it. I bought it early this morning.

Why so late, kiddies? It’s long past “sleepy-time.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Nancy</span>: We’ve been playing “Hide and Seek,” and
having the mostest fun. We promised, all of us, that if
we could play until half-past seven tonight we wouldn’t

do I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span>: I don’t. I love bed. My bed, after my
muzzer tucks me all in, is like a nice warm bag. I just
stick my nose out. When I lifts my head up I can see the
light from the dining-room come in the door. I can hear
my muzzer and fazzer talking nice and low; and then,
before I know it, I’m fast asleep, and I dream pretty
things, and in about a minute it’s morning again. I love
my little bed, and I love to dream.</p>

night! (<em>Darkly</em>) You see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Interrupting suddenly</em>): Why, where is my little
Jenny? Excuse me, Louise dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span>: Her cold is awful bad. She coughs like
this (<em>giving a distressing imitation</em>) and snuffles all the
time. She can’t talk out loud, and she can’t go to sleep.
Muzzer says she’s fev’rish&mdash;I thinks that’s what she says.
Jenny says she knows she could go to sleep, if you would

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I certainly will. I’ll go when you do, honey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Little Martha</span> (<em>Softly stroking Rachel’s arm</em>): You’re
the very nicest “grown-up”, (<em>loyally</em>) except my muzzer,
of course, I ever knew. You knows all about little chil’run

I think you would make a lovely muzzer. (<em>To the rest

you. (<em>Rises, as do the rest. Little Martha puts her hand

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Well, how is everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Oh! about the same, I guess. Tom’s out.
John, we’ll never forget you&mdash;and your kindness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: That was nothing. And Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: She’ll be back presently. She went to sit
with a sick child for a little while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: And how is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: She’s not herself yet, but I think she is better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>After a short pause</em>): Well, what <em>did</em> happen&mdash;exactly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: That’s just what I don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: When you came home&mdash;you couldn’t get in&mdash;was
that it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes. (<em>Pauses</em>). It was just a week ago
today. I was down town all the morning. It was about
one o’clock when I got back. I had forgotten my key.
I rapped on the door and then called. There was no
answer. A window was open, and I could feel the air
under the door, and I could hear it as the draught sucked
it through. There was no other sound. Presently I
made such a noise the people began to come out into the
hall. Jimmy was in one of the flats playing with a little
girl named Mary. He told me he had left Rachel here a
short time before. She had given him four cookies, two
for him and two for Mary, and had told him he could play
with her until she came to tell him his lunch was ready.
I saw he was getting frightened, so I got the little girl
and her mother to keep him in their flat. Then, as no
man was at home, I sent out for help. Three men broke
the door down. (<em>Pauses</em>). We found Rachel unconscious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
lying on her face. For a few minutes I thought
she was dead. (<em>Pauses</em>). A vase had fallen over on
the table and the water had dripped through the cloth and
onto the floor. There had been flowers in it. When I
left, there were no flowers here. What she could have
done to them, I can’t say. The long stems were lying
everywhere, and the flowers had been ground into the
floor. I could tell that they must have been roses from
the stems. After we had put her to bed and called the
doctor, and she had finally regained consciousness, I very
naturally asked her what had happened. All she would
say was, “Ma dear, I’m too&mdash;tired&mdash;please.” For four
days she lay in bed scarcely moving, speaking only when
spoken to. That first day, when Jimmy came in to see
her, she shrank away from him. We had to take him out,
and comfort him as best we could. We kept him away,
almost by force, until she got up. And, then, she was
utterly miserable when he was out of her sight. What
happened, I don’t know. She avoids Tom, and she won’t
tell me. (<em>Pauses</em>). Tom and I both believe her soul
has been hurt. The trouble isn’t with her body. You’ll
find her highly nervous. Sometimes she is very much
depressed; again she is feverishly gay&mdash;almost reckless.
What do you think about it, John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Who has listened quietly</em>): Had anybody been
here, do you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: No, I don’t. I don’t like to ask Rachel; and
I can’t ask the neighbors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: No, of course not. (<em>Pauses</em>). You say there
were some flowers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: And the flowers were ground into the carpet?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Did you happen to notice the box? They must
have come in a box, don’t you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Yes, there was a box in the kitchenette. It
was from “Marcy’s.” I saw no card.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Slowly</em>): It is rather strange. (<em>A long silence,
during which the outer door opens and shuts. Rachel is
heard singing. She stops abruptly. In a second or two
she appears in the door. There is an air of suppressed
excitement about her</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Hello! John. (<em>Strong rises, nods at her, and brings
forward for her the big arm-chair near the fire</em>). I
thought that was your hat in the hall. It’s brand new,
I know&mdash;but it looks&mdash;“Johnlike.” How are you? Ma!
Jenny went to sleep like a little lamb. I don’t like her
breathing, though. (<em>Looks from one to the other; flippantly</em>)
Who’s dead? (<em>Nods her thanks to Strong for
the chair and sits down</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Dead, Rachel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes. The atmosphere here is so funereal,&mdash;it’s
positively “crapey.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I don’t know why it should be&mdash;I was just asking
how you are.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Heavens! Does the mere inquiry into my health
precipitate such an atmosphere? Your two faces were
as long, as long&mdash;(<em>Breaks off</em>). Kind sir, let me assure
you, I am in the very best of health. And how are you,
John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Oh! I’m always well. (<em>Sits down</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Loving</span>: Rachel, I’ll have to get ready to go now.
John, don’t hurry. I’ll be back shortly, probably in three-quarters
of an hour&mdash;maybe less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: And maybe more, if I remember Mrs. Jordan.
However, Ma dear, I’ll do the best I can&mdash;while you are
away. I’ll try to be a credit to your training. (<em>Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
Loving smiles and goes out the rear doorway</em>). Now,
let’s see&mdash;in the books of etiquette, I believe, the properly
reared young lady, always asks the young gentleman
caller&mdash;you’re young enough, aren’t you, to be classed still
as a “young gentleman caller?” (<em>No answer</em>). Well,
anyway, she always asks the young gentleman caller
sweetly something about the weather. (<em>Primly</em>) This
has been an exceedingly beautiful day, hasn’t it, Mr.
Strong? (<em>No answer from Strong, who, with his head
resting against the back of the chair, and his knees
crossed is watching her in an amused, quizzical manner</em>).
Well, really, every properly brought up young gentleman,
I’m sure, ought to know, that it’s exceedingly rude not to
answer a civil question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Lazily</em>): Tell me what to answer, Rachel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Say, “Yes, Very”; and look interested and pleased
when you say it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>With a half-smile</em>): Yes, very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well, I certainly wouldn’t characterize that as a
particularly animated remark. Besides, when you look
at me through half-closed lids like that&mdash;and kind of
smile&mdash;what are you thinking? (<em>No answer</em>) John
Strong, are you deaf or&mdash;just plain stupid?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Plain stupid, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>In wheedling tones</em>): What were you thinking,
John?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Slowly</em>): I was thinking&mdash;(<em>Breaks off</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Irritably</em>): Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I’ve changed my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: You’re not going to tell me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: No.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>Mrs. Loving dressed for the street comes in</em>).</p>

much with John. Let me see&mdash;if I have my key. (<em>Feels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>

(<em>Strong and Rachel rise. He bows</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Good-bye, Ma dear. Hurry back as soon as you
can, won’t you? (<em>Exit Mrs. Loving through the vestibule.
Strong leans back again in his chair, and watches
Rachel through half-closed eyes. Rachel sits in her chair
nervously</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Do you mind, if I smoke?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: You know I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: I am trying to behave like&mdash;Reginald&mdash;“the properly
reared young gentleman caller.” (<em>Lights a cigar;
goes over to the fire, and throws his match away. Rachel
goes into the kitchenette, and brings him a saucer for his
ashes. She places it on the table near him</em>). Thank you.
(<em>They both sit again, Strong very evidently enjoying his
cigar and Rachel</em>). Now this is what I call cosy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Cosy! Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: A nice warm room&mdash;shut in&mdash;curtains drawn&mdash;a
cheerful fire crackling at my back&mdash;a lamp, not an
electric or gas one, but one of your plain, old-fashioned
kerosene ones&mdash;.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Interrupting</em>): Ma dear would like to catch you,
I am sure, talking about <em>her</em> lamp like that. “Old-fashioned!
plain!”&mdash;You have nerve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Continuing as though he had not been interrupted</em>):
A comfortable chair&mdash;a good cigar&mdash;and not
very far away, a little lady, who is looking charming, so
near, that if I reached over, I could touch her. You there&mdash;and
I here.&mdash;It’s living.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Well! of all things! A compliment&mdash;and from
<em>you</em>! How did it slip out, pray? (<em>No answer</em>). I
suppose that you realize that a conversation between two
persons is absolutely impossible, if one has to do her share
all alone. Soon my ingenuity for introducing interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
subjects will be exhausted; and then will follow what,
I believe, the story books call, “an uncomfortable silence.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Slowly</em>): Silence&mdash;between friends&mdash;isn’t such a
bad thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Thanks awfully. (<em>Leans back; cups her cheek
in her hand, and makes no pretense at further conversation.
The old look of introspection returns to her eyes.
She does not move</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Quietly</em>): Rachel! (<em>Rachel starts perceptibly</em>)
You must remember I’m here. I don’t like looking into
your soul&mdash;when you forget you’re not alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: I hadn’t forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Wouldn’t it be easier for you, little girl, if you
could tell&mdash;some one?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: No. (<em>A silence</em>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Rachel,&mdash;you’re fond of flowers,&mdash;aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: Rosebuds&mdash;red rosebuds&mdash;particularly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Twisting her hands</em>): Oh, John! I’m so sorry,
Ma dear told you that. She didn’t know, you sent them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: So I gathered. (<em>Pauses and then leans forward;
quietly</em>). Rachel, little girl, why&mdash;did you kill them?</p>

kill?</p>

one knows about it&mdash;not even my mother. It’s completely
furnished now&mdash;and waiting&mdash;do you know for whom?
Every single thing in it, I’ve bought myself&mdash;even to the
pins on the little bird’s-eye maple dresser. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
the happiest year I have ever known. I furnished it&mdash;one
room at a time. It’s the prettiest, the most homelike
little flat I’ve ever seen. (<em>Very low</em>) Everything there&mdash;breathes
love. Do you know for whom it is waiting? On
the sitting-room floor is a beautiful, Turkish rug&mdash;red, and
blue and gold. It’s soft&mdash;and rich&mdash;and do you know for
whose little feet it is waiting? There are delicate curtains
at the windows and a bookcase full of friendly, eager,
little books.&mdash;Do you know for whom they are waiting?
There are comfortable leather chairs, just the right size,
and a beautiful piano&mdash;that I leave open&mdash;sometimes, and
lovely pictures of Madonnas. Do you know for whom
they are waiting? There is an open fireplace with logs
of wood, all carefully piled on gleaming andirons&mdash;and
waiting. There is a bellows and a pair of shining tongs&mdash;waiting.
And in the kitchenette painted blue and white,
and smelling sweet with paint is everything: bright pots

and all kinds of knives and forks and spoons&mdash;and on the
door&mdash;a roller-towel. Little girl, do you know for whom
they are all waiting? And somewhere&mdash;there’s a big,

Ma dear’s sixty&mdash;and she said once she is much older than
that. She is. We are all blighted; we are all accursed&mdash;all
of us&mdash;, everywhere, we whose skins are dark&mdash;our
lives blasted by the white man’s prejudice. (<em>Pauses</em>)
And my little Jimmy&mdash;seven years old, that’s all&mdash;is
blighted too. In a year or two, at best, he will be made
old by suffering. (<em>Pauses</em>): One week ago, today, some
white boys, older and larger than my little Jimmy, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
was leaving the school&mdash;called him “Nigger”! They
chased him through the streets calling him, “Nigger!
Nigger! Nigger!” One boy threw stones at him. There
is still a bruise on his little back where one struck him.
That will get well; but they bruised his soul&mdash;and that&mdash;will
never&mdash;get well. He asked me what “Nigger” meant.
I made light of the whole thing, laughed it off. He went
to his little playmates, and very naturally asked them.
The oldest of them is nine!&mdash;and they knew, poor
little things&mdash;and they told him. (<em>Pauses</em>). For the
last couple of nights he has been dreaming&mdash;about
these boys. And he always awakes&mdash;in the dark&mdash;afraid&mdash;afraid&mdash;of
the now&mdash;and the future&mdash;I have seen
that look of deadly fear&mdash;in the eyes&mdash;of other little
children. I know what it is myself.&mdash;I was twelve&mdash;when
some big boys chased me and called me names.&mdash;I
never left the house afterwards&mdash;without being afraid.
I was afraid, in the streets&mdash;in the school&mdash;in the church,
everywhere, always, afraid of being hurt. And I&mdash;was
not&mdash;afraid in vain. (<em>The weeping begins again</em>). He’s
only a baby&mdash;and he’s blighted. (<em>To Jimmy</em>) Honey,
I’m right here. I’m coming in just a minute. Don’t cry.
(<em>To Strong</em>) If it nearly kills me to hear my Jimmy’s
crying, do you think I could stand it, when my own child,
flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood&mdash;learned the same
reason for weeping? Do you? (<em>Pauses</em>). Ever since
I fell here&mdash;a week ago&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;to go&mdash;to sleep,
for every time I do&mdash;my children come&mdash;and beg me&mdash;weeping&mdash;not
to&mdash;bring them here&mdash;to suffer. Tonight,
they came&mdash;when I was awake. (<em>Pauses</em>). I have
promised them again, now&mdash;by Jimmy’s bed. (<em>In a
whisper</em>) I have damned&mdash;my soul to all eternity&mdash;if I do.
(<em>To Jimmy</em>) Honey, don’t! I’m coming. (<em>To Strong</em>)
And John,&mdash;dear John&mdash;you see&mdash;it can never be&mdash;all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
beautiful, beautiful things&mdash;you have&mdash;told me about.
(<em>Wistfully</em>) No&mdash;they&mdash;can never be&mdash;now. (<em>Strong
comes toward her</em>) No,&mdash;John dear,&mdash;you&mdash;must not&mdash;touch
me&mdash;any more. (<em>Pauses</em>). Dear, this&mdash;is&mdash;“Good-bye.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Quietly</em>): It’s not fair&mdash;to you, Rachel, to take
you&mdash;at your word&mdash;tonight. You’re sick; you’ve brooded
so long, so continuously,&mdash;you’ve lost&mdash;your perspective.
Don’t answer, yet. Think it over for another week
and I’ll come back.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>Wearily</em>): No,&mdash;I can’t think&mdash;any more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: You realize&mdash;fully&mdash;you’re sending me&mdash;for always?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: And you care?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span>: It’s settled, then for all time&mdash;“Good-bye!”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span> (<em>After a pause</em>): Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strong</span> (<em>Stands looking at her steadily a long time, and then
moves to the door and turns, facing her; with infinite tenderness</em>):
Good-bye, dear, little Rachel&mdash;God bless you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rachel</span>: Good-bye, John! (<em>Strong goes out. A door
opens and shuts. There is finality in the sound. The
weeping continues. Suddenly; with a great cry</em>) John!
John! (<em>Runs out into the vestibule. She presently returns.
She is calm again. Slowly</em>) No! No! John. Not
for us. (<em>A pause; with infinite yearning</em>) Oh! John,&mdash;if
it only&mdash;if it only&mdash;(<em>Breaks off, controls herself.
Slowly again; thoughtfully</em>) No&mdash;No sunshine&mdash;no laughter&mdash;always,
always&mdash;darkness. That is it. Even our
little flat&mdash;(<em>In a whisper</em>) John’s and mine&mdash;the little flat&mdash;that
calls, calls us&mdash;through darkness. It shall wait&mdash;and
wait&mdash;in vain&mdash;in darkness. Oh, John! (<em>Pauses</em>).
And my little children! my little children! (<em>The weeping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
ceases; pauses</em>). I shall never&mdash;see&mdash;you&mdash;now.
Your little, brown, beautiful bodies&mdash;I shall never see.&mdash;Your
dimples&mdash;everywhere&mdash;your laughter&mdash;your tears&mdash;the
beautiful, lovely feel of you here. (<em>Puts her hands
against her heart</em>). Never&mdash;never&mdash;to be. (<em>A pause,
fiercely</em>) But you are somewhere&mdash;and wherever you are
you are mine! You are mine! All of you! Every bit
of you! Even God can’t take you away. (<em>A pause; very
sweetly; pathetically</em>) Little children!&mdash;My little children!&mdash;No
more need you come to me&mdash;weeping&mdash;weeping.
You may be happy now&mdash;you are safe. Little weeping,
voices, hush! hush! (<em>The weeping begins again. To
Jimmy, her whole soul in her voice</em>) Jimmy! My little
Jimmy! Honey! I’m coming.&mdash;Ma Rachel loves you so.
(<em>Sobs and goes blindly, unsteadily to the rear doorway;
she leans her head there one second against the door; and
then stumbles through and disappears. The light in the
lamp flickers and goes out.... It is black. The terrible,
heart-breaking weeping continues</em>).</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
